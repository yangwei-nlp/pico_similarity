BACKGROUD: The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic and adverse effects
of oxycodone with 3 different infusion modes on postoperative pain after
laparoscopic radical surgery of cervical cancer.
METHODS: Ninety patients undergoing laparoscopic radical surgery of cervical
cancer were randomly divided into 3 groups: Group A (continuous infusion with
0.01 mg/kg/h and a bolus dose with 0.03 mg/kg), Group B (a bolus dose with
0.03 mg/kg) and Group C (PCA was administered as a time-scheduled decremental
continuous infusion based on lean body mass). A blinded observer recorded Visual 
Analogue Scale (VAS), Ramsay sedation score (RSS), infused cumulative dose of
oxycodone and side effects at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively, and
satisfaction during the postoperative 48 hours.
RESULTS: There were significant differences in the VAS pain score when resting or
coughing among 3 groups at 1, 6 and 48 hours postoperatively (P <.05). VAS was
significantly higher in Group B than in Group A and C until postoperative 1, 6,
and 48 hours (P <.05). There were significant differences in cumulative PCA dose 
among the 3 groups at 1 and 48 hours postoperatively (P <.05). Group C showed
significantly less amount of cumulative PCA dose compared to other 2 groups at
1 hour, whereas cumulative PCA dose of Group A at 48 hours was significantly more
than other 2 groups (P <.05). There were no significant differences in
postoperative nausea and vomiting, FAS, muscle chilling score and RSS among 3
groups at 1, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. In addition, there was no
difference in overall satisfaction during 48 hours postoperatively among 3
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Oxycodone provides significant analgesic effect in 3 different
infusion modes over 48 hours after laparoscopic radical surgery of cervical
cancer, and a time-scheduled decremental continuous infusion of oxycodone can
become a better choice for patients after surgery of cervical cancer.

BACKGROUND: The study aims to investigate the effect and safety of
sustained-release oxycodone hydrochloride as background dose on pain titration in
patients with moderate-to-severe cancer pain.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Adult patients scheduled with a regular strong opioid for
cancer-related pain were recruited and randomly assigned to sustained-release
oxycodone group (tablets, 12 hourly) and immediate-release morphine group (5 mg
initially, hourly). All patients were hourly reassessed for efficacy and dose
titration.
RESULTS: The primary end point was the number of titration cycles required to
achieve adequate pain relief (numerical rating scale, NRS ≤ 3). Secondary end
points included the proportion of patients achieving adequate pain relief during 
each cycle, potential predictive factors for titration performance, and side
effects. Ninety (94.7%) patients in oxycodone group and 78 (86.7%) patients in
morphine group achieved adequate pain control during 1 to 4 cycles of titration. 
Patients in oxycodone group reached adequate pain control within the first 2
cycles of titration, which was significantly shorter than morphine group wherein 
the number of titration cycles ranged from 1 to 4 (P = .034). Oxycodone
prescription significantly increased the response rate of patients to morphine
titration during the first cycle of titration (P = .010). The initial NRS score
and oxycodone administration were significantly associated with titration
performance. The mild or moderate adverse effects were similar in 2 groups, while
severe adverse effects were only identified in morphine group (P = .001).
CONCLUSION: Use of background sustained-release oxycodone is more efficient and
better tolerated on dose titration than immediate-release morphine.

PURPOSE: Opioids are the primary choice for managing chronic cancer pain.
However, many nonopioid therapies are currently prescribed for chronic cancer
pain with little published evidence comparing their efficacy.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) comparing any systemic pharmaceutical intervention and/or combination
thereof in treating chronic cancer pain. The primary outcome was global efficacy 
reported as an odds ratio (OR). The secondary outcome was change in pain
intensity reported as a standardized mean difference (SMD).
RESULTS: We included 81 RCTs consisting of 10,003 patients investigating 11
medication classes. Most RCTs (80%) displayed low risk of bias. The top-ranking
classes for global efficacy were nonopioid analgesics (network OR, 0.30; 95%
credibility interval [CrI], 0.13 to 0.67), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(network OR, 0.44; 95% CrI, 0.22 to 0.90), and opioids (network OR, 0.49; 95%
CrI, 0.27 to 0.86), whereas the top-ranked interventions were lidocaine (network 
OR, 0.04; 95% CrI, 0.01 to 0.18; surface under the cumulative ranking curve
analysis [SUCRA] score, 98.1), codeine plus aspirin (network OR, 0.22; 95% CrI,
0.08 to 0.63; SUCRA score, 81.1), and pregabalin (network OR, 0.29; 95% CrI, 0.08
to 0.92; SUCRA score, 73.8). In terms of reducing pain intensity, we found that
no class was superior to placebo, whereas the following top-ranked interventions 
were superior to placebo: ziconotide (network SMD, -24.98; 95% CrI, -32.62 to
-17.35; SUCRA score, 99.8), dezocine (network SMD, -13.56; 95% CrI, -23.37 to
-3.69; SUCRA score, 93.5), and diclofenac (network SMD, -11.22; 95% CrI, -15.91
to -5.80; SUCRA score, 92.9).
CONCLUSION: There are significant differences in efficacy among current regimens 
for chronic cancer pain. Our evidence suggests that certain nonopioid analgesics 
and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can serve as effectively as opioids in
managing chronic cancer pain.

BACKGROUND: Pain due to oral mucositis (OM) is a major problem during concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients.
METHODS: We enrolled 56 NPC patients receiving CCRT and allocated them into two
groups: moderate pain group (n = 27) and a severe pain group (n = 29) according
to the degree of pain reported (moderate = numerical rating scale (NRS) score 4-6
or severe = NRS score 7-10) at initiation of controlled-release oxycodone (CRO)
treatment.
RESULTS: Total dose of CRO was significantly higher in severe pain patients than 
in moderate pain patients (791.60 ± 332.449 mg vs. 587.27 ± 194.940 mg;
P = 0.015). Moderate pain patients had significantly better quality of life
(P = 0.037), lower weight loss (P = 0.030) and more active CCRT response (90.9%
vs. 64.0%; P = 0.041). Although 24-h pain control rate was comparable in the two 
groups (85.2% vs. 86.2%; P = 0.508), the moderate pain group score eventually
stabilized at ~ 2 vs. 3 in the severe pain group (P < 0.001); the titration time 
to reach bearable pain (NRS ≤ 3) was also significantly shorter in moderate pain 
patients (2.45 ± 0.60 days vs. 3.60 ± 1.98 days; P = 0.012). Incidence of adverse
events was comparable in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that early introduction of low-dose CRO
at the moderate pain stage could help reduce the total dose required, provide
better pain control, improve quality of life, and enhance CCRT response.

Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.

Background: Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a recently introduced
alternative technique for the treatment of hepatic cancer. Anesthesia is required
for RFA of hepatic cancer to achieve patient comfort and immobilization during
this painful procedure. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
analgesic efficacy and evaluate the safety of a single intravenous injection of
oxycodone hydrochloride for this procedure.
Patients and methods: A total of 120 American Society of Anesthesiologists class 
I-II grade patients for elective ultrasound-guided percutaneous RFA were enrolled
in this randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive
either a single intravenous injection of oxycodone (group O) or continuous
infusion of remifentanil (group R). Both groups received the continuous infusion 
of dexmedetomidine for sedation. Visual analog scale (VAS), rescue analgesic, and
side effects were checked during the periprocedural period. In addition, patient 
and oncologist satisfaction on a scale of 1-5 were determined.
Results: VAS score in group O was significantly lower than in group R at 1, 2,
and 3 hours after RFA, and patients in group O required analgesics significantly 
later and less doses in the first 24 hours after RFA. The occurrence of unwanted 
body movements was significantly lower in group O. We found no complications
including allergic reaction, excessive sedation, and chest wall rigidity in all
patients. The patient satisfaction score was significantly higher in group O than
that in group R.
Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous RFA for hepatic cancer can be
completed both with continuous infusion of remifentanil or a single intravenous
injection of oxycodone. However, oxycodone hydrochloride provides better patient 
experience with higher satisfactory score and less unwanted body movements,
relieves post-procedural pain better, and is not associated with an increase in
adverse effects.

Background: Guidelines recommend morphine as the first-line pharmacological
treatment for cancer dyspnoea. However, trials with other opioids have not been
performed. Our aim was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of oxycodone to
morphine for relieving dyspnoea in cancer patients.
Methods: We conducted a multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomized
control trial. We randomly and equally assigned cancer patients on regular
oxycodone who developed dyspnoea to get a single dose of oral immediate-release
oxycodone or morphine. We evaluated the change in dyspnoea intensity (numeric
rating scale: 0-10) and adverse events after the medication administration.
Results: This study was preconfidence interval -maturely terminated. All 17
enroled patients (8 using oxycodone, 9 using morphine) completed evaluations. In 
the oxycodone group, dyspnoea intensity decreased 1.75 points [95% confidence
interval, 0.72-2.78] at 60 min and 1.50 points (95% confidence interval, -0.11 to
3.11) at 120 min. In the morphine group, dyspnoea decreased 1.33 points (95%
confidence interval, 0.41-2.25) at 60 min and 1.00 point (95% confidence
interval, -0.08 to 2.08) at 120 min. The differences did not fulfil the
non-inferiority requirement. Although two and four patients in morphine group
developed drowsiness at 60 and 120 min, no patient in oxycodone group developed
significant adverse events.
Conclusions: Although we did not show the non-inferiority of oxycodone, oxycodone
may have some effectiveness for cancer dyspnoea without significant safety
concern.

BACKGROUND: Morphine and oxycodone are considered as wide-spreadly used opioids
for moderate/severe cancer pain. However, debate exists about the evidence
regarding their relative tolerability and underlying results.
METHODS: A systematic search of online electronic databases, including PubMed,
Embase, Cochrane library updated on October 2017 were conducted. The
meta-analysis was performed including the studies that were designed as
randomized controlled trials.
RESULTS: In total, seven randomized clinical trials met our inclusion criteria.
No statistical differences in analgesic effect between oxycodone and morphine
were observed. Both the pooled analysis of API (MD =0.01, 95% CI -0.22 - 0.23;
p = 0.96) and WPI (MD = - 0.05, 95% CI -0.21 - 0.30; p = 0.72) demonstrated
clinical non-inferiority of the efficacy of morphine compared with oxycodone,
respectively. Additionally, no significant difference in PRR response was
observed in either oxycodone or morphine that were used in patients (MD =0.99,
95% CI -0.88 - 1.11; p = 0.87). With the pooled result of AEs indicating the
comparable safety profiles between the 2 treatment groups, the meta-analysis on
the nausea (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.90-1.59; p = 0.22), vomiting (OR = 1.33, 95% CI
0.75-2.38; p = 0.33), somnolence (OR = 1.35, 95% CI 0.95-1.93; p = 0.10),
diarrhea (OR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.60-1,67; p = 0.98), and constipation (OR = 1.04,
95% CI 0.77-1.41; p = 0.79) was conducted, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, no remarkable difference was identified either
in analgesic efficacy or in tolerability of oxycodone and morphine as the
first-line therapy for patients with moderate to severe cancer pain. Thus, no
sufficient clinical evidence on the superior effects of oxycodone to morphine was
provided in this experimental hypothesis.

BACKGROUND: Opioids are the foundation of treatment for cancer pain but can cause
side-effects, one of the most common being nausea and vomiting, which can impair 
quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence for the management of opioid-induced nausea
and vomiting. This systematic review was undertaken as part of an update of the
European Association for Palliative Care's opioid guidelines.
DESIGN: Searches of MEDLINE (1966-2017) and EMBASE (1980-2017) were done. Key
eligibility criteria were: randomized controlled trials conducted in patients
with cancer. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and
Evaluations system was applied to formulate recommendations.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies were eligible (1524 patients). The studies were grouped 
as follows: opioid switching (n = 8); the use of antiemetics to treat
opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (n = 4); and change of route of administration
of the opioid (n = 3). Three recommendations were formulated: A weak
recommendation for switching from morphine to oxycodone in cancer patients with
nausea (quality D); a weak recommendation for switching from tramadol to either
codeine or hydrocodone for pain in cancer patients with nausea (quality D); and a
weak recommendation for switching from morphine/oxycodone to methadone using the 
three-day switch method in patients with increasing pain considered untreatable
with further opioid titration and/or with opioid-related side effects (quality
C).
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review can make only weak recommendations for the
management of opioid-induced nausea and vomiting. There remains a need for
high-quality studies before strong recommendations on the management of
opioid-induced nausea and vomiting can be made.

BACKGROUND: A randomized controlled trial was performed to compare analgesic
effects and adverse effects of oxycodone and sufentanil in patient-controlled
intravenous analgesia (PCIA) after abdominal surgery under general anesthesia.
METHODS: Adult patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery were randomly
allocated into oxycodone and sufentanil groups according to the randomization
sequence. Study personnel, health-care team members, and patients were masked to 
the group assignment throughout the study period. Oxycodone (0.1 mg/kg for
endoscopy; 0.15 mg/kg for laparotomy) or sufentanil (0.1 μg/kg for endoscopy;
0.15 μg/kg for laparotomy) was administrated at the end of surgeries.
Postoperative pain was controlled using PCIA. Bolus dose was 2 mg and 2 μg for
oxycodone and sufentanil group, respectively. The lockout time was 5 minutes for 
all patients, and there was no background infusion for oxycodone group, whereas
0.02 μg/kg/h background infusion was administrated in sufentanil group. The
primary outcomes were the total analgesic doses in PCIA, effective bolus times,
the length of first bolus since patients returning to ward from postanesthesia
care unit (PACU), rescue analgesic rate in PACU, numeric rating scales,
functional activity scores, and patients' satisfaction scores.
RESULTS: A total of 200 patients were screened, and 175 patients were enrolled.
Patients were randomly assigned to oxycodone (n = 87) and sufentanil (n = 88)
groups. Both oxycodone and sufentanil PCIA provided adequate postoperative pain
relief. Patients in oxycodone group showed a shorter consciousness recovery time 
after surgery. The major adverse effect in patients from oxycodone group was
nausea/vomiting, whereas multiple adverse complications including
nausea/vomiting, pruritus, and respiratory depression were observed in patients
from sufentanil group. Patients from oxycodone group showed significantly reduced
analgesic drug consumption (calculated as equivalent dose of morphine),
functional activity scores, and patient satisfaction scores.
DISCUSSION: Compared with sufentanil PCIA, oxycodone PCIA showed better analgesic
effects, lower incidence of adverse complications, and less analgesic drug
consumption during postoperative pain management.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2008 Apr 16;(2):CD006332.

BACKGROUND: Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) is characterised by
constipation, incomplete evacuation, bloating, and gastric reflux. It is one of
the major adverse events of treatment for pain in cancer and in palliative care, 
resulting in increased morbidity and reduced quality of life.This is an update of
two Cochrane reviews. One was published in 2011, Issue 1 on laxatives and
methylnaltrexone for the management of constipation in people receiving
palliative care; this was updated in 2015 and excluded methylnaltrexone. The
other was published in 2008, Issue 4 on mu-opioid antagonists (MOA) for OIBD. In 
this updated review, we only included trials on MOA (including methylnaltrexone) 
for OIBD in people with cancer and people receiving palliative care.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of MOA for OIBD in people with
cancer and people receiving palliative care.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,
MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science to August 2017. We also searched
clinical trial registries and regulatory websites. We contacted manufacturers of 
MOA to identify further data.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed
the effectiveness and safety of MOA for OIBD in people with cancer and people at 
a palliative stage irrespective of the type of terminal disease they experienced.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors assessed risk of bias and
extracted data. The appropriateness of combining data from the trials depended
upon sufficient homogeneity across the trials. Our primary outcomes were
laxation, impact on pain relief, and adverse events. Impact on pain relief was a 
primary outcome because a possible adverse effect of MOAs is a reduction in pain 
relief from opioids. We assessed the evidence on these outcomes using GRADE.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified four new trials for this update, bringing the total
number included in this review to eight. In total, 1022 men and women with cancer
irrespective of stage or at a palliative care stage of any disease were
randomised across the trials. The MOAs evaluated were oral naldemedine and
naloxone (alone or in combination with oxycodone), and subcutaneous
methylnaltrexone. The trials compared with MOA with a placebo or with the active 
intervention administered at different doses or in combination with other drugs. 
The trial of naldemedine and the two of naloxone in combination with oxycodone
were in people with cancer irrespective of disease stage. The trial on naloxone
alone was in people with advanced cancer. The four trials on methylnaltrexone
were undertaken in palliative care where most participants had cancer. All trials
were vulnerable to biases; four were at a high risk as they involved a sample of 
fewer than 50 participants per arm.In the trial of naldemedine compared to
placebo in 225 participants, there were more spontaneous laxations over the
two-week treatment for the intervention group (risk ratio (RR) 1.93, 95%
confidence intervals (CI) 1.36 to 2.74; moderate-quality evidence). In comparison
with higher doses, lower doses resulted in fewer spontaneous laxations (0.1 mg
versus 0.2 mg: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.95; 0.1 mg versus 0.4 mg: RR 0.69, 95%
CI 0.53 to 0.89; moderate-quality evidence). There was moderate-quality evidence 
that naldemedine had no effect on opiate withdrawal. There were five serious
adverse events. All were in people taking naldemedine (low-quality evidence).
There was an increase in the occurrence of other (non-serious) adverse events in 
the naldemedine groups (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.79, moderate-quality evidence).
The most common adverse event was diarrhoea.The trials on naloxone taken either
on its own, or in combination with oxycodone (an opioid) compared to oxycodone
only did not evaluate laxation response over the first two weeks of
administration. There was very low-quality evidence that naloxone alone, and
moderate-quality evidence that oxycodone/naloxone, had no effect on analgesia.
There was low-quality evidence that oxycodone/naloxone did not increase the risk 
of serious adverse events and moderate-quality evidence that it did not increase 
risk of adverse events.In combined analysis of two trials of 287 participants, we
found methylnaltrexone compared to placebo induced more laxations within 24 hours
(RR 2.77, 95% CI 1.91 to 4.04. I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). In combined
analysis, we found methylnaltrexone induced more laxation responses over two
weeks (RR 9.98, 95% CI 4.96 to 20.09. I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). The
proportion of participants who had a rescue-free laxation response within 24
hours of the first dose was 59.1% in the methylnaltrexone arms and 19.1% in the
placebo arm. There was moderate-quality evidence that the rate of opioid
withdrawal was not affected. Methylnaltrexone did not increase the likelihood of 
a serious adverse event; there were fewer in the intervention arm (RR 0.59, 95%
CI 0.38 to 0.93; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). There was no difference in 
the proportion of participants experiencing an adverse event (RR 1.17, 95% CI
0.94 to 1.45; I² = 74%; low-quality evidence). Methylnaltrexone increased the
likelihood of abdominal pain and flatulence.Two trials compared differing
methylnaltrexone schedules of higher doses with lower doses. For early laxation, 
there was low-quality evidence of no clear difference between doses on analgesia 
and adverse events. Both trials measured laxation response within 24 hours of
first dose (trial one: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.66; trial two: RR 1.07, 95% CI
0.81 to 1.42).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In this update, the conclusions for naldemedine are new.
There is moderate-quality evidence to suggest that, taken orally, naldemedine
improves bowel function over two weeks in people with cancer and OIBD but
increases the risk of adverse events. The conclusions on naloxone and
methylnaltrexone have not changed. The trials on naloxone did not assess laxation
at 24 hours or over two weeks. There is moderate-quality evidence that
methylnaltrexone improves bowel function in people receiving palliative care in
the short term and over two weeks, and low-quality evidence that it does not
increase adverse events. There is a need for more trials including more
evaluation of adverse events. None of the current trials evaluated effects in
children.

PURPOSE: Prospective studies on the effect of dexamethasone after microvascular
reconstructive head and neck surgery are sparse despite the widespread use of
dexamethasone in this setting. The aim of this study was to clarify whether
perioperative use of dexamethasone would improve the quality and speed of
recovery. The authors hypothesized that dexamethasone would enhance recovery and 
diminish pain and nausea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with oropharyngeal cancer and
microvascular reconstruction were included in this prospective double-blinded
randomized controlled trial. Patients in the study group (n = 51) received
dexamethasone 60 mg over 3 perioperative days; 42 patients did not receive
dexamethasone and served as controls. Patient rehabilitation, postoperative
opioid and insulin consumption, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and
C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocyte, and lactate levels were recorded.
RESULTS: There was significantly less pain in the study group (P = .030) and the 
total oxycodone dose for 5 days postoperatively was lower (P = .040).
Dexamethasone did not significantly lessen PONV for 5 days postoperatively
(P > .05). There were no differences between groups in intensive care unit or
hospital stay or in other clinical measures of recovery. Patients receiving
dexamethasone required significantly more insulin compared with patients in the
control group (P < .001). Lactate and leukocyte levels were significantly higher 
(P < .001) and CRP levels were significantly lower in the study group.
CONCLUSION: The only benefit of perioperative dexamethasone use was lower total
oxycodone dose; however, the disadvantages were greater. Because dexamethasone
can have adverse effects on the postoperative course, routine use of
dexamethasone as a pain or nausea medication during reconstructive head and neck 
cancer surgery is not recommended.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Oxidative stress biomarker superoxide dismutase (SOD1) plasma
levels in operated gallstone patients versus cancer patients are unknown. In
addition, the number of analgesic doses during the first 24 h postoperatively
(NAD24) in gallstone patients operated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) or 
minicholecystectomy (MC) is unreported. The aim of the study was to determine a
correlation between the plasma SOD1 levels in the LC and MC patients versus
cancer patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Initially, 114 patients with symptomatic gallstone disease 
were randomized into LC (n=54) or MC (n=60) groups. The plasma levels of the SOD1
marker were measured just before, immediately after (POP1) and 6 h after the
operation (POP2).
RESULTS: The median plasma SOD1 levels preoperatively and following surgery in
the LC and MC patients versus cancer patients were statistically insignificant
(p=0.90, p=0.88, p=0.21, respectively). The median plasma levels of SOD1
increased immediately after operation (POP1) and the postoperative elevation
between the preoperative (PRE) and the POP1 values in the SOD1 marker were
statistically significant (p=0.027). Then the median plasma levels of SOD1 marker
decreased 6 h postoperatively (POP2) and the decrease between the POP1 and POP2
values in the SOD1 marker were statistically highly significant (p<0.001). There 
is a highly significant inverse correlation between the individual values of the 
NAD24 and plasma SOD1 values postoperatively in LC and MC patients (r=-0.335,
p=0.011).
CONCLUSION: The plasma SOD1 levels preoperatively and following surgery in the LC
and MC patients versus cancer patients were quite similar. Cholecystectomy
patients with enhanced levels of SOD1 appeared to have significantly lower number
of analgesic oxycodone doses during the first 24 h postoperatively (NAD24).

Background: Hydromorphone is a standard opioid analgesic for cancer pain that,
prior to this study, was not approved in Japan, where options for opioid
switching are limited. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of
hydromorphone (DS-7113b) immediate-release tablets in opioid-naïve cancer
patients with moderate to severe cancer pain.
Methods: Multicenter, active-controlled, randomized, double-blind,
parallel-group, non-inferiority study of 183 cancer patients over 20 years of age
at 50 clinical sites in Japan. Hydromorphone tablets or oxycodone hydrochloride
powder was orally administered four times daily for 5 days. The initial doses of 
hydromorphone and oxycodone hydrochloride were 4 mg/day and 10 mg/day,
respectively, and adjusted as necessary. Efficacy was evaluated as the intergroup
difference (95% confidence interval [CI]) of the least squares mean by analysis
of covariance, using the baseline visual analog scale (VAS) as a covariate for
change in VAS score at treatment completion/discontinuation in the full analysis 
set.
Results: Non-inferiority of hydromorphone versus oxycodone was confirmed, with an
intergroup difference (95% CI) in the least squares mean of -3.4 mm (-9.8 to 3.1 
mm) for change in VAS scores, which was below the upper limit of the 95% CI at 10
mm, the non-inferiority limit determined during study planning. Adverse events
occurred in 83.0% (73/88) of patients in the hydromorphone group and 77.4%
(65/84) in the oxycodone group. The most frequently observed adverse events were 
somnolence, constipation, vomiting and nausea.
Conclusions: The efficacy and safety of hydromorphone tablets are equivalent to
those of oxycodone immediate-release powder.

Objective: To explore the effects of oxycodone combined with dexmedetomidine in
percutaneous ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular
carcinomas. Methods: Sixty patients who underwent percutaneous ultrasound-guided 
radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinomas were randomly divided into
fentanyl group (group A) and oxycodone group( group B), with 30 patients in each 
group. Patients in group A were injected with fentanyl (2 μg/kg), and patients in
group B were injected with oxycodone (0.2 mg/kg). All the patients were injected 
with dexmedetomidine, with a loading dose of 0.5 μg/kg for 10 minutes and a
continuous infusion rate of 0.2 μg·kg(-1)·h(-1) until the end of the operation.
The changes of heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse oxygen
saturation (SPO(2)) and bispectral index (BIS) were monitored at different time
points: time when patients entering the operating room (T0), the beginning of
operation (T1), 10 minutes after operation (T2), the end of operation (T3), 15
minutes after the end of operation (T4). The incidence of side effects (nausea
and vomiting, respiratory depression and body movements) was assessed. The visual
analogue scale (VAS) scores were also recorded at T0, T3 and an hour
postoperatively. Results: Five patients of Group A had the body movements during 
the operation, and it was improved after injecting with fentanyl 2 μg/kg.
Compared with T0, HR in two groups decreased significantly at T2 (P<0.05). At
each time point, the difference of MAP, HR, SPO(2) and BIS was not statistically 
significant in two groups. The incidence of Nausea and vomiting, body movements
was lower in group B than that in group A(P<0.05). The VAS scores were lower in
group B than that in group A at T3 and an hour postoperatively (P<0.05).
Conclusion: The combination of oxycodone and dexmedetomidine can be used safely
and effectively in percutaneous ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation of
hepatocellular carcinomas, and it shows more effective analgesia and less
side-effects.

non-cancer pain: an overview of Cochrane Reviews.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is common and can be challenging to manage. Despite
increased utilisation of opioids, the safety and efficacy of long-term use of
these compounds for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) remains controversial. This
overview of Cochrane Reviews complements the overview entitled 'High-dose opioids
for chronic non-cancer pain: an overview of Cochrane Reviews'.
OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the occurrence and nature of adverse events
associated with any opioid agent (any dose, frequency, or route of
administration) used on a medium- or long-term basis for the treatment of CNCP in
adults.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (the Cochrane
Library) Issue 3, 2017 on 8 March 2017 to identify all Cochrane Reviews of
studies of medium- or long-term opioid use (2 weeks or more) for CNCP in adults
aged 18 and over. We assessed the quality of the reviews using the AMSTAR
criteria (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews) as adapted 
for Cochrane Overviews. We assessed the quality of the evidence for the outcomes 
using the GRADE framework.
MAIN RESULTS: We included a total of 16 reviews in our overview, of which 14
presented unique quantitative data. These 14 Cochrane Reviews investigated 14
different opioid agents that were administered for time periods of two weeks or
longer. The longest study was 13 months in duration, with most in the 6- to
16-week range. The quality of the included reviews was high using AMSTAR
criteria, with 11 reviews meeting all 10 criteria, and 5 of the reviews meeting 9
out of 10, not scoring a point for either duplicate study selection and data
extraction, or searching for articles irrespective of language and publication
type. The quality of the evidence for the generic adverse event outcomes
according to GRADE ranged from very low to moderate, with risk of bias and
imprecision being identified for the following generic adverse event outcomes:
any adverse event, any serious adverse event, and withdrawals due to adverse
events. A GRADE assessment of the quality of the evidence for specific adverse
events led to a downgrading to very low- to moderate-quality evidence due to risk
of bias, indirectness, and imprecision.We calculated the equivalent milligrams of
morphine per 24 hours for each opioid studied (buprenorphine, codeine,
dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, levorphanol,
methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, tapentadol, tilidine, and tramadol).
In the 14 Cochrane Reviews providing unique quantitative data, there were 61
studies with a total of 18,679 randomised participants; 12 of these studies had a
cross-over design with two to four arms and a total of 796 participants. Based on
the 14 selected Cochrane Reviews, there was a significantly increased risk of
experiencing any adverse event with opioids compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 
1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.66) as well as with opioids compared
to a non-opioid active pharmacological comparator, with a similar risk ratio (RR 
1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.33). There was also a significantly increased risk of
experiencing a serious adverse event with opioids compared to placebo (RR 2.75,
95% CI 2.06 to 3.67). Furthermore, we found significantly increased risk ratios
with opioids compared to placebo for a number of specific adverse events:
constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, hot flushes, increased sweating,
nausea, pruritus, and vomiting.There was no data on any of the following
prespecified adverse events of interest in any of the included reviews in this
overview of Cochrane Reviews: addiction, cognitive dysfunction, depressive
symptoms or mood disturbances, hypogonadism or other endocrine dysfunction,
respiratory depression, sexual dysfunction, and sleep apnoea or sleep-disordered 
breathing. We found no data for adverse events analysed by sex or ethnicity.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A number of adverse events, including serious adverse
events, are associated with the medium- and long-term use of opioids for CNCP.
The absolute event rate for any adverse event with opioids in trials using a
placebo as comparison was 78%, with an absolute event rate of 7.5% for any
serious adverse event. Based on the adverse events identified, clinically
relevant benefit would need to be clearly demonstrated before long-term use could
be considered in people with CNCP in clinical practice. A number of adverse
events that we would have expected to occur with opioid use were not reported in 
the included Cochrane Reviews. Going forward, we recommend more rigorous
identification and reporting of all adverse events in randomised controlled
trials and systematic reviews on opioid therapy. The absence of data for many
adverse events represents a serious limitation of the evidence on opioids. We
also recommend extending study follow-up, as a latency of onset may exist for
some adverse events.

BACKGROUND: Although opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (OINV) often result in
analgesic undertreatment in patients with cancer, no randomized controlled trials
have evaluated the efficacy of prophylactic antiemetics for preventing OINV. We
conducted this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the
efficacy and safety of prophylactic treatment with prochlorperazine for
preventing OINV.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cancer patients who started to receive oral oxycodone were
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either prochlorperazine 5 mg or
placebo prophylactically, given three times daily for 5 days. The primary
endpoint was the proportion of patients who had a complete response (CR) during
the 120 hours of oxycodone treatment. CR was defined as no emetic episode and no 
use of rescue medication for nausea and vomiting during 5 days. Key secondary
endpoints were the proportion of patients with emetic episodes, proportion of
patients with moderate or severe nausea, quality of life, and proportion of
treatment withdrawal.
RESULTS: From November 2013 through February 2016, a total of 120 patients were
assigned to receive prochlorperazine (n = 60) or placebo (n = 60). There was no
significant difference in CR rates (69.5% vs. 63.3%; p = .47) or any secondary
endpoint between the groups. Patients who received prochlorperazine were more
likely to experience severe somnolence (p = .048).
CONCLUSION: Routine use of prochlorperazine as a prophylactic antiemetic at the
initiation of treatment with opioids is not recommended. Further research is
needed to evaluate whether other antiemetics would be effective in preventing
OINV in specific patient populations.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Prophylactic prochlorperazine seems to be ineffective 
in preventing opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (OINV) and may cause adverse
events such as somnolence. Routine use of prophylactic prochlorperazine at the
initiation of treatment with opioids is not recommended. Further research is
needed to evaluate whether other antiemetics would be effective in preventing
OINV in specific patient populations.

BACKGROUND: Cancer patients experience pain that has physiological, sensory,
affective, cognitive, behavioral, and sociocultural dimensions. Opioids are used 
in treatment of pain in patients with various types of cancer. We previously
showed that the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype is related to the
plasma level of morphine and the required dose of morphine in an exploratory
prospective study. The findings showed that a group of patients with a GG single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4680 in COMT required a significantly higher dose
of morphine than a non-GG group. A biomarker for selection of opioids for cancer 
pain relief would be particularly useful clinically, and therefore we have
planned a randomized comparative study of morphine and oxycodone, using the COMT 
rs4680 SNP as a biomarker. This study is aimed at verifying the assumption that
patients in the GG group require an increased morphine dose for pain relief.
METHODS: The RELIEF study is a randomized, multi-institutional, open-label trial 
with a primary endpoint of the proportion of subjects requiring high-dose
opioids, as calculated from the dose of a rescue preparation administered on day 
0. Secondary endpoints include the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Short
form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2, European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C15-PAL, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, and adverse events, 
Eligibility criteria are patients with advanced carcinoma with non-daily use of
opioids in initial screening for registration; and cancer pain targeted for daily
opioid treatment, NSAIDs or acetaminophen, NRS ≥3(average over 24 h),
opioid-treatment naive within 30 h, no chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or
bisphosphonate administration newly started within 2 weeks, and written informed 
consent at the time of second registration. Between November 2014 and June 2017, 
an estimated 110 patients from two sites in Japan were randomized (1:1) to
morphine or oxycodone in GG and non-GG groups.
DISCUSSION: A method for selection of appropriate opioids in cancer patients is a
high unmet medical need. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of
different opioids in patients with cancer based on gene polymorphism, as the
first potential multi-institutional registration trial to be conducted in cancer 
patients with pain.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000015579 Date of registration: 4 November 2014. It is
updated once every six months, the latest update is 30 June 2017. Trial status.
The enrollment started in November 2014. At the time of manuscript submission
(July 2017), Three-quarters of patients have participated. We thus expect to
complete the recruitment by March 2018.

BACKGROUND: Controlled-release oxycodone/naloxone (OXN-CR) maintains the effect
of opioid-induced analgesia through oxycodone while reducing the occurrence rate 
of opioid-induced constipation through naloxone. The present study was designed
to assess the non-inferiority of OXN-CR to controlled-release oxycodone (OX-CR)
for the control of cancer-related pain in Korean patients.
METHODS: In this randomized, open-labeled, parallel-group, phase IV study, we
enrolled patients aged 20 years or older with moderate to severe cancer-related
pain [numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score ≥4] from seven Korean
oncology/hematology centers. Patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population 
were randomized (1:1) to OXN-CR or OX-CR groups. OXN-CR was administered starting
at 20 mg/10 mg per day and up-titrated to a maximum of 80 mg/40 mg per day for
4 weeks, and OX-CR was administered starting at 20 mg/day and up-titrated to a
maximum of 80 mg/day for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in
NRS pain score from baseline to week 4, with non-inferiority margin of -1.5.
Secondary endpoints included analgesic rescue medication intake, patient-reported
change in bowel habits, laxative intake, quality of life (QoL), and safety
assessments.
RESULTS: Of the ITT population comprising 128 patients, 7 with missing primary
efficacy data and 4 who violated the eligibility criteria were excluded from the 
efficacy analysis. At week 4, the mean change in NRS pain scores was not
significantly different between the OXN-CR group (n = 58) and the OX-CR group
(n = 59) (-1.586 vs. -1.559, P = 0.948). The lower limit of the one-sided 95%
confidence interval (-0.776 to 0.830) for the difference exceeded the
non-inferiority margin (P < 0.001). The OXN-CR and OX-CR groups did not differ
significantly in terms of analgesic rescue medication intake, change in bowel
habits, laxative intake, QoL, and safety assessments.
CONCLUSIONS: OXN-CR was non-inferior to OX-CR in terms of pain reduction after
4 weeks of treatment and had a similar safety profile. Studies in larger
populations of Korean patients with cancer-related pain are needed to further
investigate the effectiveness of OXN-CR for long-term pain control and
constipation alleviation. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01313780,
registered March 8, 2011.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To compare analgesia and adverse effects during oral morphine
and oxycodone and transdermal fentanyl and buprenorphine administration in cancer
patients with pain.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer patients treated at home and in outpatient clinics
with severe pain (numerical rating scale score 6-10) fail to respond to
non-opioids and/or weak opioids. All patients were randomized to either morphine,
oxycodone, fentanyl or buprenorphine and divided into subgroups with predominant 
neuropathic and nociceptive pain component. Doses of opioids were titrated to
satisfactory analgesia and acceptable adverse effects intensity. Patients were
assessed at baseline and followed for 28 days. In all patient groups,
immediate-release oral morphine was the rescue analgesic and lactulose 10 mL
twice daily was the prophylaxis of constipation; no antiemetics were used as
prophylaxis.
RESULTS: A total of 62 patients participated and 53 patients completed the study.
Good analgesia was obtained for all 4 opioids, for both nociceptive and
neuropathic pain. The use of co-analgesics was greater in patients with
neuropathic pain. Morphine treatment was associated with less negative impact of 
pain on ability to walk, work and activity (trend) according to Brief Pain
Inventory-Short Form scores and less consumption of rescue morphine. The most
common adverse effects included nausea and drowsiness, which increased at the
beginning of the treatment and gradually decreased over the days to come.
Appetite, well-being, anxiety, depression, and fatigue improved. There was no
constipation (the Bowel Function Index scores were within normal range) during
the treatment with all opioids. No changes were seen for constipation, vomiting
and dyspnea.
CONCLUSION: All opioids were effective and well-tolerated. Morphine was the most 
effective in the improvement in some of the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form items
regarding negative impact of pain on patients' daily activities. Prophylaxis of
constipation was effective; antiemetics may be considered for nausea prevention.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2015 Feb 27;(2):CD003870.

BACKGROUND: Many people with cancer experience moderate to severe pain that
requires treatment with strong opioids, such as oxycodone and morphine. Strong
opioids are, however, not effective for pain in all people, neither are they
well-tolerated by all people. The aim of this review was to assess whether
oxycodone is associated with better pain relief and tolerability than other
analgesic options for adults with cancer pain. This is an updated version of the 
original Cochrane review published in 2015, Issue 2 on oxycodone for
cancer-related pain.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and tolerability of oxycodone by any
route of administration for pain in adults with cancer.
SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and MEDLINE
In-Process (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Science Citation Index, Conference Proceedings 
Citation Index - Science (ISI Web of Science), BIOSIS (ISI), and PsycINFO (Ovid) 
to November 2016. We also searched four trial registries, checked the
bibliographic references of relevant studies, and contacted the authors of the
included studies. We applied no language, date, or publication status
restrictions.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (parallel group or
cross-over) comparing oxycodone (any formulation or route of administration) with
placebo or an active drug (including oxycodone) for cancer background pain in
adults by examining pain intensity/relief, adverse events, quality of life, and
participant preference.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and
assessed the included studies using standard Cochrane methodology. We
meta-analysed pain intensity data using the generic inverse variance method, and 
adverse events using the Mantel-Haenszel method, or summarised these data
narratively along with the quality of life and participant preference data. We
assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE.
MAIN RESULTS: For this update, we identified six new studies (1258 participants) 
for inclusion. In total, we included 23 studies which enrolled/randomised 2648
participants, with 2144 of these analysed for efficacy and 2363 for safety. The
studies examined a number of different drug comparisons.Pooled analysis of three 
of the four studies comparing controlled-release (CR) oxycodone to
immediate-release (IR) oxycodone showed that the ability of CR and IR oxycodone
to provide pain relief were similar (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.1, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) -0.06 to 0.26; low quality evidence). Pooled analyses of
adverse events showed no significant differences between CR and IR oxycodone for 
asthenia (risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.68), confusion (RR 0.78, 95% CI
0.2 to 3.02), constipation (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.13),
dizziness/lightheadedness (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.37), drowsiness/somnolence
(RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.54), dry mouth (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.75),
insomnia (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.53), nausea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.28),
nervousness (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.64), pruritus (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.65 to
3.25), vomiting (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.15), and discontinuation due to
adverse events (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.22). The quality of the evidence was
very low for all these adverse events. Three of the four studies found similar
results for treatment acceptability.Pooled analysis of seven of the nine studies 
comparing CR oxycodone to CR morphine indicated that pain relief was
significantly better after treatment with CR morphine than CR oxycodone (SMD
0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.27; low quality evidence). However, sensitivity analysis
did not corroborate this result (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.26).Pooled analyses 
of adverse events showed no significant differences between CR oxycodone and CR
morphine for confusion (RR 1.01 95% CI 0.78 to 1.31), constipation (RR 0.98, 95% 
CI 0.82 to 1.16), dizziness/lightheadedness (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.76),
drowsiness/somnolence (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.08), dry mouth (RR 1.01, 95% CI
0.8 to 1.26), dysuria (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.26), nausea (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82
to 1.26), pruritus (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.29), vomiting (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.68
to 1.29), and discontinuation due to adverse events (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.43 to
2.6). However, the RR for hallucinations was significantly lower after treatment 
with CR oxycodone compared to CR morphine (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.97). The
quality of the evidence was very low for all these adverse events. There were no 
marked differences in treatment acceptability or quality of life ratings.The
remaining studies either compared oxycodone in various formulations or compared
oxycodone to different alternative opioids. None found any clear superiority or
inferiority of oxycodone for cancer pain, neither as an analgesic agent nor in
terms of adverse event rates and treatment acceptability.The quality of this
evidence base was limited by the high or unclear risk of bias of the studies and 
by imprecision due to low or very low event rates or participant numbers for many
outcomes.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The conclusions have not changed since the previous version
of this review. The data suggest that oxycodone offers similar levels of pain
relief and overall adverse events to other strong opioids including morphine.
Although we identified a clinically insignificant benefit on pain relief in
favour of CR morphine over CR oxycodone, this did not persist following
sensitivity analysis and so we do not consider this important. However, in this
updated analysis, we found that hallucinations occurred less often with CR
oxycodone than with CR morphine, but the quality of this evidence was very low so
this finding should be treated with utmost caution. Our conclusions are
consistent with other reviews and suggest that while the reliability of the
evidence base is low, given the absence of important differences within this
analysis it seems unlikely that larger head to head studies of oxycodone versus
morphine are justified, although well-designed trials comparing oxycodone to
other strong analgesics may well be useful. For clinical purposes, oxycodone or
morphine can be used as first-line oral opioids for relief of cancer pain in
adults.

University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.

This study aims to explore the effect of oxycodone hydrochloride injection on the
immune function of patients who underwent radical resection of rectal cancer
under general anesthesia.Eighty patients were enrolled and randomly divided into 
group A and B (n = 40, each). All patients underwent general intravenous
anesthesia. At the end of surgery, each patient in group A was injected with 5 mg
(5 mL) of oxycodone hydrochloride, while 5 mg (5 mL) of morphine hydrochloride in
group B. Venous blood was withdrawn in both groups at different time points.
Changes in the numbers of T lymphocyte subsets and natural killer (NK) cells were
determined by flow cytometry.First the numbers of T lymphocyte subsets and NK
cells at T1, T2, T3, and T4 decreased in both groups, compared with those at T0, 
and the differences were statistically significant. Furthermore, the numbers
reduced to a minimum at T2 and began to recover at T3. Second the differences
between group A and B at T1, T2, T3, and T4 were statistically significant; and
the numbers of T lymphocytes and NK cells were higher in group A than in group B 
at corresponding time points.Oxycodone hydrochloride and morphine hydrochloride
both have inhibitory effects on immune function in patients undergoing radical
resection of rectal cancer after surgery. However, oxycodone hydrochloride has a 
smaller effect compared to morphine hydrochloride.

BACKGROUND: Pain is a common feature of childhood and adolescence around the
world, and for many young people, that pain is chronic. The World Health
Organization guidelines for pharmacological treatments for children's persisting 
pain acknowledge that pain in children is a major public health concern of high
significance in most parts of the world. While in the past, pain was largely
dismissed and was frequently left untreated, views on children's pain have
changed over time, and relief of pain is now seen as importantWe designed a suite
of seven reviews on chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain (looking at
antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
opioids, and paracetamol as priority areas) in order to review the evidence for
children's pain utilising pharmacological interventions in children and
adolescents.As the leading cause of morbidity in children and adolescents in the 
world today, chronic disease (and its associated pain) is a major health concern.
Chronic pain (lasting three months or longer) can arise in the paediatric
population in a variety of pathophysiological classifications: nociceptive,
neuropathic, idiopathic, visceral, nerve damage pain, chronic musculoskeletal
pain, and chronic abdominal pain, and other unknown reasons.Opioids are used
worldwide for the treatment of pain. They bind to opioid receptors in the central
nervous system (mu, kappa, delta, and sigma) and can be agonists, antagonists,
mixed agonist-antagonists, or partial agonists. Opioids are generally available
in healthcare settings across most high-income countries, but access may be
restricted in low- and middle-income countries. For example, opioids currently
available in the UK include: buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone,
methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol. Opioids are used in varying doses
(generally based on body weight for paediatric patients) by means of parenteral, 
transmucosal, transdermal, or oral administration (immediate release or modified 
release). To achieve adequate pain relief in children using opioids, with an
acceptable grade of adverse effects, the recommended method is a lower dose
gradually titrated to effect in the child.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of opioids used
to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents aged between birth
and 17 years, in any setting.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via Ovid, and Embase via Ovid from
inception to 6 September 2016. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved 
studies and reviews, and searched online clinical trial registries.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials, with or without blinding, of
any dose and any route, treating chronic non-cancer pain in children and
adolescents, comparing opioids with placebo or an active comparator.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies
for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio and
number needed to treat, using standard methods. We assessed GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and planned to create a
'Summary of findings' table.
MAIN RESULTS: No studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. We rated the
quality of the evidence as very low. We downgraded the quality of evidence by
three levels due to the lack of data reported for any outcome.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence from randomised controlled trials to 
support or refute the use of opioids to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children
and adolescents. We are unable to comment about efficacy or harm from the use of 
opioids to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents.We know from
adult randomised controlled trials that some opioids, such as morphine and
codeine, can be effective in certain chronic pain conditions.This means that no
conclusions could be made about efficacy or harm in the use of opioids to treat
chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents.

CONTEXT: Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is one of the most frequent and severe
adverse events (AEs) after treatment with opioids. Recent studies have indicated 
that fixed-ratio combination prolonged-release oxycodone/naloxone (OXN PR) could 
decrease OIC with similar pain relief compared with other opioids.
OBJECTIVES: We systematically reviewed (PROSPERO registration numbers:
CRD42016036244) the constipation relief of OXN PR compared with other opioids
regardless of formulation, prolonged release, or extended release used for the
relief of chronic pain.
METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Web of
Science, and the Cochrane library from inception to May 2016, with an update to
December 2016. We quantitatively analyzed OIC (assessed by bowel function index
[BFI]), pain intensity, and AEs.
RESULTS: A total of 167 articles were identified from the databases. Finally
seven studies with 3217 patients were included in our meta-analysis, including
1322 patients in OXN PR treatment groups and 1885 patients in prolonged-release
oxycodone (OXY PR) or prolonged-release morphine (MOR PR) control group. The
relative risk (RR) of OIC was decreased in OXN PR (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.44; 0.62).
Whether BFI was better or worse at baseline, the mean difference (MD) of BFI
-17.48 95% CI -21.60; -13.36) was better after treatment with OXN PR with
clinical importance at the end of intervention; moreover, the BFI of the OXN
PR-treated group was closer to normal BFI scores. However, clinical BFI change
from baseline to the end measurement only existed in patients when the baseline
BFI was high (mean [SDs] 61.0 [23.39]-67.40 [19.51]), and the MD of the BFI was
-15.96 (95% CI -25.56; -15.48). The RR of AEs was also smaller (RR 0.80; 95% CI
0.69-0.93), but the severity or duration of AEs was not reported. Pain intensity 
was also significantly decreased in the OXN PR treatment groups (MD -3.84, 95% CI
-7.14; -0.55), although there was no clinically meaningful difference.
CONCLUSION: For people with chronic pain, treatment with OXN PR decreases the
incidence of OIC and provides intermediate-term bowel function improvement with
clinical importance; in addition, pain relief is not weakened. The OIC after
treatment with OXN PR for cancer-related pain and over the long term remains
unknown.

BACKGROUND: Pain is a common feature of childhood and adolescence around the
world, and for many young people, that pain is chronic. The World Health
Organization (WHO) guidelines for pharmacological treatments for children's
persisting pain acknowledge that pain in children is a major public health
concern of high significance in most parts of the world. Views on children's pain
have changed over time and relief of pain is now seen as important. In the past, 
pain was largely dismissed and was frequently left untreated, and it was assumed 
that children quickly forgot about painful experiences.We designed a suite of
seven reviews in chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain (looking at
antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
opioids, and paracetamol) to review the evidence for children's pain using
pharmacological interventions.As one of the leading causes of mortality and
morbidity for children and adolescents in the world today, childhood cancer (and 
its associated pain) is a major health concern. Cancer pain in infants, children,
and adolescents is primarily nociceptive pain with negative long term effects.
Cancer-related pain is generally caused directly by the tumour itself such as
compressing on the nerve or inflammation of the organs. Cancer-related pain
generally occurs as a result of perioperative procedures, nerve damage caused by 
radiation or chemotherapy treatments, or mucositis. However, this review focused 
on pain caused directly by the tumour itself such as nerve infiltration, external
nerve compression, and other inflammatory events.Opioids are used worldwide for
the treatment of pain. Currently available opioids include: buprenorphine,
codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol.
Opioids are generally available in healthcare settings across most developed
countries but access may be restricted in developing countries. To achieve
adequate pain relief in children using opioids, with an acceptable grade of
adverse effects, the recommended method is to start with a low dose gradually
titrated to effect or unacceptable adverse effect in the child.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the analgesic efficacy, and adverse events, of opioids used
to treat cancer-related pain in children and adolescents aged between birth and
17 years, in any setting.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE via Ovid and
Embase via Ovid from inception to 22 February 2017. We also searched the
reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and searched online clinical
trial registries.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with or without
blinding, of any dose, and any route, treating cancer-related pain in children
and adolescents, comparing opioids with placebo or an active comparator.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies
for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio and
number needed to treat for one additional event, using standard methods. We
assessed GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
Evaluation) and planned to create a 'Summary of findings' table.
MAIN RESULTS: No studies were identified that were eligible for inclusion in this
review (very low quality evidence). Several studies tested opioids on adults with
cancer-related pain, but none in participants aged from birth to 17 years.We
rated the quality of evidence as very low, downgraded due to a lack of available 
data; no analyses could be undertaken.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No conclusions can be drawn about efficacy or harm in the
use of opioids to treat cancer-related pain in children and adolescents. As a
result, there is no RCT evidence to support or refute the use of opioids to treat
cancer-related pain in children and adolescents.

Opioids for cancer pain - an overview of Cochrane reviews.

BACKGROUND: Pain is a common symptom with cancer, and 30% to 50% of all people
with cancer will experience moderate to severe pain that can have a major
negative impact on their quality of life. Opioid (morphine-like) drugs are
commonly used to treat moderate or severe cancer pain, and are recommended for
this purpose in the World Health Organization (WHO) pain treatment ladder. The
most commonly-used opioid drugs are buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl,
hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, tramadol, and
tapentadol.
OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the analgesic efficacy of opioids in cancer
pain, and to report on adverse events associated with their use.
METHODS: We identified systematic reviews examining any opioid for cancer pain
published to 4 May 2017 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in the
Cochrane Library. The primary outcomes were no or mild pain within 14 days of
starting treatment, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse
events.
MAIN RESULTS: We included nine reviews with 152 included studies and 13,524
participants, but because some studies appeared in more than one review the
number of unique studies and participants was smaller than this. Most
participants had moderate or severe pain associated with a range of different
types of cancer. Studies in the reviews typically compared one type of opioid or 
formulation with either a different formulation of the same opioid, or a
different opioid; few included a placebo control. Typically the reviews titrated 
dose to effect, a balance between pain relief and adverse events. Various routes 
of administration of opioids were considered in the reviews; oral with most
opioids, but transdermal administration with fentanyl, and buprenorphine. No
review included studies of subcutaneous opioid administration. Pain outcomes
reported were varied and inconsistent. The average size of included studies
varied considerably between reviews: studies of older opioids, such as codeine,
morphine, and methadone, had low average study sizes while those involving newer 
drugs tended to have larger study sizes.Six reviews reported a GRADE assessment
(buprenorphine, codeine, hydromorphone, methadone, oxycodone, and tramadol), but 
not necessarily for all comparisons or outcomes. No comparative analyses were
possible because there was no consistent placebo or active control. Cohort
outcomes for opioids are therefore reported, as absolute numbers or percentages, 
or both.Reviews on buprenorphine, codeine with or without paracetamol,
hydromorphone, methadone, tramadol with or without paracetamol, tapentadol, and
oxycodone did not have information about the primary outcome of mild or no pain
at 14 days, although that on oxycodone indicated that average pain scores were
within that range. Two reviews, on oral morphine and transdermal fentanyl,
reported that 96% of 850 participants achieved that goal.Adverse event withdrawal
was reported by five reviews, at rates of between 6% and 19%. Participants with
at least one adverse event were reported by three reviews, at rates of between
11% and 77%.Our GRADE assessment of evidence quality was very low for all
outcomes, because many studies in the reviews were at high risk of bias from
several sources, including small study size.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The amount and quality of evidence around the use of
opioids for treating cancer pain is disappointingly low, although the evidence we
have indicates that around 19 out of 20 people with moderate or severe pain who
are given opioids and can tolerate them should have that pain reduced to mild or 
no pain within 14 days. This accords with the clinical experience in treating
many people with cancer pain, but overstates to some extent the effectiveness
found for the WHO pain ladder. Most people will experience adverse events, and
help may be needed to manage the more common undesirable adverse effects such as 
constipation and nausea. Perhaps between 1 in 10 and 2 in 10 people treated with 
opioids will find these adverse events intolerable, leading to a change in
treatment.

Anesthesiology, Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Yuhang District, Hangzhou, 
People's Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: Problems like body movement, respiratory depression, and complained
of pain are still common phenomenon in outpatient artificial abortion general
anesthesia. Oxycodone hydrochloride is a semisynthetic opioid and has a good
therapeutic effect on visceral pain. We hypothesize that oxycodone hydrochloride 
would be superior to fentanyl in outpatient artificial abortion surgery.
METHODS: In this clinical trial 149 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I
or II female outpatients scheduled for elective artificial abortion surgeries
under general anesthesia were randomly divided into 3 groups: oxycodone
hydrochloride 0.06 mg/kg group (group A), oxycodone hydrochloride 0.08 mg/kg
group (group B), and control group fentanyl 2 ug/kg (group C). The primary
outcome was level body movement and respiratory depression during the surgery,
the second outcome included the visual analogue scale (VAS) score 30 minutes
after waking.
RESULTS: A total of 120 participants completed the study, n = 40 in each group.
There was no significant difference in patients' age, body mass index (BMI),
preoperative heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, consumption dose of
propofol, intraoperative body movement type and times, and duration of surgery
among the 3 groups (P > .05). Comparing the incidence of intraoperative
respiratory depression and SPO2 < 90% among the 3 groups, group C's was
significantly higher than those of groups A and B, and the difference was
statistically significant (P < .05). Group A had no difference compared with
group B. In VAS score 30minutes after waking, group C was the highest, followed
by group A, with group B as the lowest. The difference among the 3 groups was
statistically significant (P < .05), but a difference delta less than 1 on the
VAS scale is not clinically significant.
CONCLUSION: The analgesic effect of oxycodone hydrochloride at 0.06 mg/kg applied
to painless artificial abortion surgery is not superior than that of fentanyl,
but the incidence of intraoperative respiratory depression and hypoxemia is
significantly lower than fentanyl.

BACKGROUND: Oxycodone/naloxone (OXN PR) is a prolonged-release formulation
containing oxycodone and naloxone in a 2:1 ratio. This study aimed to evaluate
the tolerability and efficacy of doses up to OXN160/80 mg PR compared with
oxycodone prolonged-release formulation (OxyPR) in a randomised controlled trial.
METHODS: Two hundred and forty-three patients were randomised to treatment with
OXN PR (n = 123) or OxyPR (n = 120) during the 5-week double-blind study.
Measured were: opioid-induced constipation [bowel function index score (BFI)];
analgesic efficacy (NRS 0-10); daily laxative rescue medication use; rescue
medication use, and the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs)
per week. A subanalysis was conducted in cancer patients.
RESULTS: Greater reductions in mean BFI scores were reported for the OXN PR group
compared with OxyPR from Week 1 onwards; at Week 5 the mean change from baseline 
was -32.5 versus -14.2. Average 24-h pain scores were low and remained stable in 
the range 3-4 in both treatment groups. Analgesic rescue medication use was
similar between the groups. Patients receiving OXN PR used significantly lower
mean daily doses of laxative rescue medication than those receiving OxyPR
(P = 0.006). The number of CSBM in the OXN PR group approximately doubled
compared with a 25% decrease in the OxyPR group. Comparable results to the total 
study population were reported in the cancer patient subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS: OXN PR in daily doses of up to 160/80 mg significantly improves
bowel function compared with equivalent doses of OxyPR while still providing
comparable analgesic efficacy.
SIGNIFICANCE: Effective analgesia can be achieved using oxycodone/naloxone PR up 
to 160/80 mg daily without compromising bowel function. A similar outcome was
reported in cancer and non-cancer patients.

(1)Pain Research and Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences (Nuffield
Division of Anaesthetics), University of Oxford, Pain Research Unit, Churchill
Hospital, Oxford, Oxfordshire, UK, OX3 7LE.

BACKGROUND: Tramadol is an opioid analgesic licensed for use in moderate to
severe pain. It is considered as a low risk for abuse, so control regulations are
not as stringent as for 'strong' opioids such as morphine. It has a potential
role as a step 2 option of the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and adverse effects of tramadol with or
without paracetamol (acetaminophen) for cancer-related pain.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases using a wide range of search 
terms: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE,
Embase, and LILACS. We also searched three clinical trials registry databases.
The date of the last search was 2 November 2016.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected studies that were randomised, with placebo or
active controls, or both, and included a minimum of 10 participants per treatment
arm. We were interested particularly in blinded studies, but also included open
studies.We excluded non-randomised studies, studies of experimental pain, case
reports, and clinical observations.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data
using a standard form and checked for agreement before entry into Review Manager 
5. We included information about the number of participants treated and
demographic details, type of cancer, drug and dosing regimen, study design
(placebo or active control) and methods, study duration and follow-up, analgesic 
outcome measures and results, withdrawals, and adverse events. We collated
multiple reports of the same study, so that each study, rather than each report, 
was the unit of interest in the review. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and 
created a 'Summary of findings' table.The main outcomes of interest for benefit
were pain reduction of 30% or greater and 50% or greater from baseline,
participants with pain no worse than mild, and participants feeling much improved
or very much improved.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 studies (12 reports) with 958 adult participants.
All the studies enrolled participants with chronic malignant tumour-related pain 
who were experiencing pain intensities described as moderate to severe, with most
experiencing at least 4/10 with current treatment. The mean ages were 59 to 70
years, with participants aged between 24 and 87 years. Study length ranged from
one day to six months. Five studies used a cross-over design. Tramadol doses
ranged from 50 mg as single dose to 600 mg per day; doses of 300 mg per day to
400 mg per day were most common.Nine studies were at high risk of bias for one to
four criteria (only one high risk of bias for size). We judged all the results to
be very low quality evidence because of widespread lack of blinding of outcome
assessment, inadequately described sequence generation, allocation concealment,
and small numbers of participants and events. Important outcomes were poorly
reported. There were eight different active comparators and one comparison with
placebo. There was little information available for any comparison and no firm
conclusions could be drawn for any outcome.Single comparisons of oral tramadol
with codeine plus paracetamol, of dihydrocodeine, and of rectal versus oral
tramadol provided no data for key outcomes. One study used tramadol combined with
paracetamol; four participants received this intervention. One study compared
tramadol with flupirtine - a drug that is no longer available. One study compared
tramadol with placebo and a combination of cobrotoxin, tramadol, and ibuprofen,
but the dosing schedule poorly explained.Two studies (191 participants) compared 
tramadol with buprenorphine. One study (131 participants) reported a similar
proportion of no or mild pain at 14 days.Three studies (300 participants)
compared tramadol with morphine. Only one study, combining tramadol, tramadol
plus paracetamol, and paracetamol plus codeine as a single weak-opioid group
reported results. Weak opioid produced reduction in pain of at least 30% from
baseline in 55/117 (47%) participants, compared with 91/110 (82%) participants
with morphine. Weak opioid produced reduction in pain of at least 50% in 49/117
(42%) participants, compared with 83/110 (75%) participants with morphine.There
was no useful information for any other outcome of benefit or harm.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited, very low quality, evidence from
randomised controlled trials that tramadol produced pain relief in some adults
with pain due to cancer and no evidence at all for children. There is very low
quality evidence that it is not as effective as morphine. This review does not
provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the
effect will be substantially different is very high. The place of tramadol in
managing cancer pain and its role as step 2 of the WHO analgesic ladder is
unclear.

BACKGROUND: The inclusion of naloxone with oxycodone in a fixed combination
prolonged-release formulation (OXN PR) improves bowel function compared with
oxycodone (Oxy) alone without compromising analgesic efficacy. In a recent
5-week, randomized, double-blind comparative trial of OXN PR and OxyPR, it could 
be shown that the beneficial properties of OXN PR extend to doses up to
160/80 mg.
METHODS: Bowel function, pain, quality of life (QoL) and safety of OXN PR up to
180/90 mg daily were evaluated in a 24-week open-label extension phase of the
5-week randomized comparative study in patients with non-malignant or malignant
pain requiring opioids and suffering from opioid-induced constipation.
RESULTS: During treatment with a mean (SD) daily dose OXN PR of 130.7 (26.56) mg 
(median, maximum: 120 and 180 mg), the Bowel Function Index (BFI) decreased from 
45.3 (26.37) to 26.7 (21.37) with the largest decrease seen in the first week.
The average pain over the last 24 h remained stable (median Pain Intensity Scale 
score 4.0) and QoL was maintained throughout the study. Adverse events were
consistent with the known effects of OXN PR and no new safety concerns emerged.
Equivalent efficacy and safety benefits were observed in cancer patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The OXN PR in doses up to 180/90 mg provides effective analgesia
with maintenance of bowel function during long-term treatment. The beneficial
effects of such dose levels of OXN PR contribute to stable patient-reported QoL
and health status despite serious underlying pain conditions, such as cancer.
SIGNIFICANCE: In patients with pain requiring continuous opioid therapy at doses 
above 80 mg of oxycodone, stable and effective long-term analgesia can be
achieved using OXN PR up to 180/90 mg daily without compromising bowel function
and may be preferential to supplemental oxycodone.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the postoperative analgesia efficacy, rehabilitation
parameters and complication between multimodal analgesia and traditional
analgesia after radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer patients.
METHODS: Patients with gastric cancer who underwent surgery in our hospital from 
October 2016 to December 2016 were enrolled in this prospective study. According 
to the non-randomized method, patients were assigned to multimodal analgesia
group(n=32) and traditional analgesia group(n=33) in gastric cancer treatment
team A and B in Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, West China Hospital,
Sichuan University. The treatment measures of group A were as follows: (1) The
ratio of 1/1 diluted ropivacaine (100 mg, 10 ml) was infiltrated around the
incision before abdomen closure, with incision sutured layer by layer. (2)
Parecoxib sodium (40 mg) was injected intravenously every 12 hours after
operation for 5 days. (3) Oxycodone-acetaminophen tablet was given orally on the 
first day or the second day after operation, 50 mg twice a day. (4)
Patient-controlled analgesia was not used after operation. Patients in group B
received direct suture of incision and patient-controlled analgesia. The pain
score, postoperative rehabilitation and 30-day postoperative complications were
collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: Multimodal analgesia group had lower pain scores at 1 d (4.8±0.9), 2 d
(4.3±1.0), 3 d (2.9±0.8), 4 d (2.4±0.7) and 5 d (1.7±0.7) after surgery, as
compared to traditional analgesia group (5.9±0.9, P=0.000), (5.1±0.7, P=0.001),
(3.9±0.8, P=0.000), (3.0±0.6, P=0.000), (2.6±0.7, P=0.000), with significant
difference. Postoperative hospital stay [(8.2±1.6) days vs. (10.6±2.2) days,
P=0.000], time to ambulation [(47.5±13.8) days vs. (66.2±16.8) days, P=0.000],
time to first flatus [(76.4±25.2) days vs. (120.0±29.9) days, P=0.000], time to
first defecate [(117.3±42.2) days vs. (159.7±30.7) days, P=0.000] and time to
first fluid diet [(83.8±21.6) days vs. (141.9±33.9) days, P=0.000] in the
multimodal analgesia group were significantly shorter than those in the
traditional analgesia group. There was no significant difference between the two 
groups with respect to 30-day postoperative complication rate(9.4% vs. 9.1%,
P=1.000).
CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal analgesia can significantly reduce the postoperative pain
and is beneficial to rehabilitation, meanwhile it does not increase the risk of
postoperative complications. Multimodal analgesia is safe and effective for
gastric cancer patients undergoing radical gastrectomy.

Pain affects approximately 80% of patients with pancreatic cancer, with half
requiring strong opioid analgesia, namely: morphine-based drugs on step three of 
the WHO analgesic ladder (as opposed to the weak opioids: codeine and tramadol). 
The presence of pain is associated with reduced survival. This article reviews
the literature regarding pain: prevalence, mechanisms, pharmacological, and
endoscopic treatments and identifies areas for research to develop individualized
patient pain management pathways. The online literature review was conducted
through: PubMed, Clinical Key, Uptodate, and NICE Evidence. There are two
principal mechanisms for pain: pancreatic duct obstruction and pancreatic
neuropathy which, respectively, activate mechanical and chemical nociceptors. In 
pancreatic neuropathy, several histological, molecular, and immunological changes
occur which correlate with pain including: transient receptor potential cation
channel activation and mast cell infiltration. Current pain management is
empirical rather etiology-based and is informed by the WHO analgesic ladder for
first-line therapies, and then endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus
neurolysis (EUS-CPN) in patients with resistant pain. For EUS-CPN, there is only 
one clinical trial reporting a benefit, which has limited generalizability. Case 
series report pancreatic duct stenting gives effective analgesia, but there are
no clinical trials. Progress in understanding the mechanisms for pain and when
this occurs in the natural history, together with assessing new therapies both
pharmacological and endoscopic, will enable individualized care and may improve
patients' quality of life and survival.

AIM: To evaluate if pre- and post-procedure administration of controlled-release 
oxycodone (CRO) in combination with standard analgesia improves pain control and 
decreases the amount of required post-procedure opioids in uterine fibroid
embolisation (UFE).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2009 and March 2010, 60 consecutive women 
were prospectively randomised in two groups for UFE: the control group, in which 
30 patients underwent the standard anaesthetic procedure and the CRO group, in
which 30 patients underwent the standard anaesthetic procedure with the addition 
of CRO. Age, pain, nausea/vomiting, fibroid volume, length of hospital stay, and 
use and dose of morphine received via the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)
device in both groups were evaluated to compare the two methods of pain control. 
Fibroid volume as measured at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was evaluated for 
correlation with post-embolisation pelvic pain over a period of 24 hours.
RESULTS: A significant difference was seen in the pain scores at 24 hours
(p=0.029), with less pain in the CRO group. More patients from the control group 
required morphine (p=0.017), and at higher levels (p=0.130). Pruritus was lower
in patients of the CRO group, probably because they received less morphine
(p=0.029). No correlation was seen between leiomyoma volume and pain levels over 
24 hours (Spearman's ρ=0.02; p=0.881). Length of hospital stay was not different 
between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: The addition of CRO to standard analgesia for UFE provides more
effective analgesia, with a reduction in pain scores in 24 hours, less morphine
use, and decreased side effects, mainly pruritus.

Objective: To compare efficacy and safety of intravenous continuous infusion of
oxycodone with morphine in patients with cancer pain.
Methods: A 5-day, randomized, open-label, exploratory study at 6 sites in the
Republic of Korea. Sixty-six adults aged ≥19 years with moderate-to-severe cancer
pain (Numeric Rating Scale [NRS] ≥ 4) were enrolled. The study group received
intravenous (IV) oxycodone, and the comparator group received IV morphine which
were titrated depending on pain intensity. The efficacy endpoint is change in
average NRS score from baseline to Day 5. Other assessments included worst,
current, and average pain intensity; patient satisfaction; medication dose; and
adverse events.
Results: Both groups achieved >50% reduction in average pain intensity: from
"moderate" at baseline (oxycodone versus morphine: 6.0 ± 1.8 versus 5.9 ± 1.4) to
"mild" at Day 5 (2.5 ± 1.8 versus 2.8 ± 1.6). While this reduction was similar
between groups (3.5 ± 2.2 versus 3.1 ± 1.8, P value = 0.562), oxycodone achieved 
faster pain relief (average pain: 3.0 ± 1.6 versus 3.9 ± 1.6, P value = 0.020) on
Day 2 and significant NRS reductions for worst pain on Day 2 (P value = 0.045)
and current pain on Day 2 (P value = 0.035) and Day 5 (P value = 0.020) compared 
to morphine. Patient satisfaction, adverse events, and adverse drug reactions
were similar for both groups.
Conclusions: For Asian patients with cancer pain, IV oxycodone is faster acting
and showed similar analgesic efficacy and safety profiles as IV morphine. This
trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02660229.

BACKGROUND: Cancer pain is an important and distressing symptom that tends to
increase in frequency and intensity as the cancer advances. For people with
advanced cancer, the prevalence of pain can be as high as 90%. It has been
estimated that 30% to 50% of people with cancer categorise their pain as moderate
to severe, with between 75% and 90% of people with cancer experiencing pain that 
they describe as having a major impact on their daily life. Epidemiological
studies suggest that approximately 15% of people with cancer pain fail to
experience acceptable pain relief with conventional management. Uncontrolled pain
can lead to physical and psychological distress and can, consequently, have a
drastic effect on people's quality of life.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the analgesic efficacy of hydromorphone in relieving
cancer pain, as well as the incidence and severity of any adverse events.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,
MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trials registers up to April 2016. There were no
language, document type or publication status limitations applied in the search.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared
hydromorphone with placebo or other active pain medication for cancer pain in
both adults and children. The four main outcomes selected have previously been
identified as important to people with cancer; pain no worse than mild pain, and 
the impact of the treatment on consciousness, appetite and thirst. We did not
consider physician-, nurse- or carer-reported measures of pain.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data.
For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence
interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated 
the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We used a random-effects 
model and assessed the risk of bias for all included studies. A meta-analysis was
not completed on any of the primary outcomes in this review due to the lack of
data. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created two 'Summary of findings' 
tables.
MAIN RESULTS: We included four studies (604 adult participants), which compared
hydromorphone to oxycodone (two studies) or morphine (two studies). Overall, the 
included studies were at low or unclear risk of bias, rated unclear due to
unknown status of blinding of outcome assessment; we rated three studies at high 
risk of bias for potential conflict of interest. Data for 504 participants were
available for analysis. We collected data on endpoint participant-reported pain
intensity measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS) (mean ± standard deviation 
(SD): hydromorphone 28.86 ± 17.08, n = 19; oxycodone 30.30 ± 25.33, n = 12; scale
from 0 to 100 with higher score indicating worse pain), and Brief Pain Inventory 
(BPI) 24 hours worst pain subscale (mean ± SD: hydromorphone 3.5 ± 2.9, n = 99;
morphine 4.3 ± 3.0, n = 101, scale from 0 to 10 with higher score indicating
worse pain). The data demonstrated a similar effect between groups with both
comparisons. The pain intensity data showed that participants in all four trials 
achieved no worse than mild pain. There were several adverse events: some were
the expected opioid adverse effects such as nausea, constipation and vomiting;
others were not typical opioid adverse effects (for example, decreased appetite, 
dizziness and pyrexia, as shown in Table 1 in the main review), but generally
showed no difference between groups. There were three deaths in the morphine
group during the trial period, considered to be due to disease progression and
unrelated to the drug. Three trials had over 10% dropout, but the reason and
proportion of dropout was balanced between groups. The overall quality of
evidence was very low mainly due to high risk of bias, imprecision of effect
estimates and publication bias. There were no data available for children or for 
several participant-important outcomes, including participant-reported pain
relief and treatment impact on consciousness, appetite or thirst.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review indicated little difference between
hydromorphone and other opioids in terms of analgesic efficacy. Data gathered in 
this review showed that hydromorphone had a similar effect on
participant-reported pain intensity as reported for oxycodone and morphine.
Participants generally achieved no worse than mild pain after taking
hydromorphone, which is comparable with the other drugs. It produced a consistent
analgesic effect through the night and could be considered for use in people with
cancer pain experiencing sleep disturbance. However, the overall quality of
evidence was very low mainly due to risk of bias, imprecision of effect estimates
and publication bias. This review only included four studies with limited sample 
size and a range of study designs. Data for some important outcomes, such as
impact of the treatment on consciousness, appetite or thirst, were not available.
Therefore, we were unable to demonstrate superiority or inferiority of
hydromorphone in comparison with other analgesics for these outcomes. We
recommend that further research with larger sample sizes and more comprehensive
outcome data collection is required.

Gabapentin has been used as an adjuvant for treatment of cancer pain. Previous
studies showed that opioids combined with gabapentin for management of cancer
pain reduced the dosage of opioids.The objective of this study was to explore the
clinical effect and patients' satisfaction of oxycontin combined with gabapentin 
in treatment of severe cancer pain. After titration of morphine, 60 severe cancer
patients with visual analog score (VAS) more than 7 were randomly divided into
trial group (n = 30) and control group (n = 30). The control group was
administered oxycontin and placebo, and the trial group was given oxycontin and
gabapentin. VAS score was recorded pre- and post-treatment; while daily dose of
oxycontin, daily cost of pain relief and life quality score were observed 1 week,
1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months post-treatment. We found that daily
dose of oxycontin 1 month post was comparable between the 2 groups (P > 0.05).
Three months post, compared with control group (58.0 ± 15.2 mg), average daily
dose of oxycontin was significant lower in trial group (33.4 ± 11 mg)
(P < 0.001). Average daily cost of pain relief in trail group (34.5 ± 10.2 RMB)
was less than the control group (52.4 ± 13.7 RMB) (P < 0.001). Life quality score
increased in all of the patients in both group post-treatment (P < 0.05); while
life quality score in trail group was greater than in control group 3 months
(46.8 ± 4.5 vs 43.5 ± 4.6, P = 0.007) and 6 months (46.5 ± 4.8 vs 41.4 ± 4.3,
P < 0.001) post-treatment. The incidence of drowsiness and dizziness was
comparable between the 2 groups (P > 0.05), while the incidence of nausea and
vomiting (P = 0.038), and constipation (P < 0.001) was higher in the control
group.We concluded that oxycontin combined with gabapentin used in severe cancer 
pain management can control pain effectively, decreased the dose of oxycontin and
the cost of cancer pain relief, and reduced the incidence of nausea and vomiting,
and constipation, increased the life quality.

CONTEXT: Oxycodone and morphine are recommended as first-choice opioids for
moderate/severe cancer pain, but evidence about their relative tolerability has
significant methodological limitations.
OBJECTIVES: This study was mainly aimed at comparing the risk of developing
adverse events (AEs) with controlled-release oral morphine vs. oxycodone;
secondary aims were comparing their analgesic efficacy and testing heterogeneity 
in tolerability across different age and renal function subgroups.
METHODS: An open-label multicenter RCT (EudraCT number: 2006-003151-21) was
carried out in patients with moderate/severe cancer pain. At baseline, 7 and
14 days, patients scored on 0-10 rating scales (0-10 numerical rating scale) the 
intensity of pain and of a list of common opioid side effects. The primary end
point was the percentage of patients reporting an AE (a worsening ≥ 2 points on
any of the listed side effects); tolerability by subgroups and average follow-up 
pain intensity were compared through regression models.
RESULTS: One hundred eighty-seven patients were enrolled (47% of originally
planned). Intention to treat (ITT) analysis (N = 185, morphine 94, oxycodone 91) 
did not show any difference in the risk of developing AEs (risk difference -0.6%,
95% CI -11.0% to 9.9%) nor in analgesia (0-10 numerical rating scale pain
intensity difference -0.28, 95% CI -0.83 to 0.27). No evidence of heterogeneity
of tolerability across age and renal function patient subgroups emerged.
CONCLUSION: This trial failed to show any difference in tolerability and
analgesic efficacy of morphine and oxycodone as first-line treatment for
moderate/severe cancer pain but results interpretation is difficult due to lack
of power, potential bias from open-label design, and concerns about assay
sensitivity. These data, however, can significantly contribute to future
meta-analyses comparing WHO Step-III opioids and are relevant in designing future
randomized studies.

Objective: To evaluate the clinical effect and safety of oxycodone hydrochloride 
in the anesthesia for percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) in
hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Between March and December 2015, 60 cases of
hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing percutaneous radiofrequency ablation
surgery in Peking University Cancer Hospital were randomly divided into three
groups: oxycodone group (group Q), fentanyl group (group F) and dezocine group
(group D), 20 cases in each group. Respectively intravenously injection oxycodone
0.1 mg/kg, fentanyl 0.001 mg/kg, dezocine 0.1 mg/kg before surgery. After the
surgeon completed puncture administer propofol to maintain anesthesia. Recorded
mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen
saturation (SpO2) changes in each group at entrance, beginning of radiofrequency 
ablation (T1), radiofrequency ablation began after 10 minutes (T2), the end of
the surgical and awake. Observe the analgesia effect, respiratory depression,
nausea, vomit and other complications. Postoperative pain scores were
recorded.Using ANOVA, repeated measure variance analysis, SNK test, χ2 test and
other tests to evaluate the anesthetic effect indexes. Results: The observation
completed in all patients. Patients of three groups had no significant
differences in general information. No significant difference between MAP, HR and
SpO2 at each time points among the three groups. At the T1 time point (group Q:
(11.7±1.6)/min, group D: (12.1±1.7)/min, group F: (10.3±2.3)/min, F=5.068,
P=0.009) and T2 time point (group Q: (11.9±1.3)/min, group D: (12.2±1.4)/min,
group F: (10.7±1.3)/min, F=7.024, P=0.002), RR in group F were lower than in
group Q and group D. Pain visual analogue scores after waking (group Q: 0.2±0.7, 
group D: 0.3±0.7, group F: 1.7±1.5, F=12.981, P=0.000) and postoperative pain
score of 1 hour (group Q: 2.0±0.9, group D: 1.8±0.8, group F: 4.3±0.9, F=42.362, 
P=0.000) in the group Q and group D were significantly lower than in group F. The
body movements in group Q and group D were significantly less than in group F (3 
cases, 3 cases, 9 cases, χ2=6.400, P=0.041 ). Intraoperative respiratory
depression in group Q and group D were lower than group F (3 cases, 2 cases, 9
cases, χ2=8.012, P=0.018). Conclusions: Oxycodone hydrochloride can be used
safely and effectively for radiofrequency ablation. It has favorable hemodynamic 
stability, lower incidence of respiratory depression, and advantage in terms of
postoperative pain.

BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that oxycodone is effective in relieving acute 
postoperative pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and
tolerability of oxycodone (O) versus fentanyl (F), and the adequate potency ratio
of oxycodone and fentanyl in patients with intravenous patient-controlled
analgesia after gastric laparotomy.
METHODS: In this double-blinded, randomized, controlled study, 60 patients
undergoing elective gastric laparotomy were allocated to receive either oxycodone
or fentanyl for postoperative intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (potency
ratio 60:1). The patients received ketorolac 60 mg before the end of anesthesia
and then continued with patient-controlled analgesia for 48 hours postsurgery.
Pain severity, side effects and respiration rate were recorded 30 minutes, 3, 6, 
12, 24, and 48 hours after the surgery. Cumulative opioid requirements and
patient satisfaction were also measured.
RESULTS: The median consumption more than 48 hours after operation of oxycodone
was 50 mg (range: 40.0-62.4 mg) and fentanyl was 0.8 mg (range: 0.6-1.1 mg), and 
the percentage of patients requiring rescue medication was not statistically
significant. Numeric rating scores at rest and upon movement were significantly
lower in group O than in F (P < 0.05). Whereas the incidences of adverse events
were similar between the groups (33.3% vs 27.6%, P = 0.64), a significant higher 
sedation scores were found in patients given fentanyl at 30 minutes after the
surgery (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Oxycodone was comparable to fentanyl in the relief of postoperative
pain following gastric laparotomy. Oxycodone not only provides better
postoperative pain relief and less sedation, but also there was a tendency toward
more side effects with oxycodone.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the combination of oxycodone and
dexmedetomidine for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) after video-assisted
thoracoscopic (VATS) lobectomy.
DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.
SETTING: Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute in Jinan, China.
PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-four patients with lung cancer undergoing VATS lobectomies
were recruited.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following two
groups: oxycodone and dexmedetomidine (group OD) or oxycodone alone (group O).
Before induction of anesthesia, patients in group OD received 0.5 μg/kg,
dexmedetomidine diluted to 20 mL with physiologic saline and infused for 10
minutes intravenously. The PCA protocol was 50 mg of oxycodone and 0.05 μg/kg/h
dexmedetomidine diluted to 100 mL. Patients in group O received 20 mL of
physiologic saline infused for 10 minutes. Their PCA protocol consisted of 50 mg 
of oxycodone diluted to 100 mL. Intravenous PCA was used for postoperative
analgesia (lasting for 48 h).
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pain at rest and during movement was assessed by a
blinded observer using the Visual Analog Scale pain score (VAS) at 4, 6, 24, and 
48 hours after surgery, and the level of sedation simultaneously was assessed
using the Ramsay Sedation Scale. Total oxycodone consumption, requirements for
rescue analgesia, side effects, and satisfaction with pain management were
recorded within 48 hours after surgery. Eighty patients' data were analyzed at
the end of the study (40 in each group). Visual Analog Scale scores decreased at 
4, 6, and 24 hours at rest and during movement in group OD compared with group O 
(p<0.05). The level of patient satisfaction in group OD was significantly higher 
than that in group O (p<0.05). Oxycodone consumption in group OD was
significantly lower than that in group O (p<0.001). Group O experienced more
nausea and vomiting 6 hours after surgery than did group OD (p< 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The combination of oxycodone and dexmedetomidine for PCA after VATS
lobectomy can reduce oxycodone consumption, improve patient satisfaction, and
provide better analgesia with fewer side effects (nausea and vomiting) compared
with PCA with oxycodone alone.

PURPOSE: To identify codeine-containing cough syrups (CCS)-related modulations of
intrinsic connectivity network (ICN) and to investigate whether these changes of 
ICN can be related to duration of CCS use and to impulsivity behavior in
CCS-dependent individuals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
data in 41 CCS-dependent individuals and 34 healthy controls (HC) were scanned at
1.5T and analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA), in combination with
a "dual-regression" technique to identify the group differences of three
important resting-state networks, the default mode network (DMN), the executive
control network (ECN), and the salience network (SN) between the CCS-dependent
individuals and HC.
RESULTS: Compared with the HC, CCS-dependent individuals had aberrant intrinsic
connectivity within the DMN, ECN, and SN (P < 0.05, AlphaSim corrected).
Furthermore, a longer duration of CCS use was associated with greater
abnormalities in the intrinsic network functional connectivity (FC, P < 0.05,
Bonferroni correction). Intrinsic network FC also correlated with higher
impulsivity in CCS-dependent individuals (P < 0.05, AlphaSim corrected).
CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed aberrant DMN, ECN, and SN connectivity patterns
in CCS-dependent patients, which may provide new insight into how neuronal
communication and information integration are disrupted among DMN, ECN, and SN
key structures due to long duration of CCS use.

The adverse events (AEs) of oxycodone in cancer-related pain were controversial, 
so we conducted a meta-analysis to determine it. PubMed, Embase, CBM, CNKI,
WanFang database, The Cochrane library, Web of Science, and the reference of
included studies were searched to recognize pertinent studies. Relative risk (RR)
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all AEs were all extracted. The
fixed-effects model was used to calculate pooled RRs and 95% CIs. Power
calculation was performed using macro embedded in SAS software after all
syntheses were completed. We identified 11 eligible trials involving 1211
patients: 604 patients included in oxycodone group and 607 patients involved in
control group. Our quantitative analysis included 8 AEs, and the pooled analyses 
indicated that oxycodone compared with other opioids in cancer-related pain were 
not significantly decreased RRs of all AEs (dizziness RR = 0.94, 95% CI:
0.69-1.30, Z = 0.35, P = 0.72; nausea RR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.72-1.07, Z = 1.26,
P = 0.21; vomiting RR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.70-1.15, Z = 0.9, P = 0.37; sleepiness
RR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.38-1.36, Z = 0.36, P = 0.72; constipation RR = 0.98, 95% CI:
0.81-1.19, Z = 0.21, P = 0.83; anorexia RR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.58-1.62, Z = 0.11, 
P = 0.91; pruritus RR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.44-1.30, Z = 1.01, P = 0.31; dysuria
RR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.07-1.62, Z = 1.36, P = 0.1)]. The subgroup analysis shown
that Ox controlled-release (CR) had less sleepiness compared with MS-contin (Mc) 
CR (RR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.25-0.90, P = 0.02). The power analysis suggests that all
AEs have low statistical power. The present meta-analysis detected that no
statistically significant difference were found among oxycodone and other opioids
in all AEs, but Ox CR may had less sleepiness compared with Mc CR when subgroup
analysis were conducted.

BACKGROUND: Guidelines tend to consider morphine and morphine-like opioids
comparable and interchangeable in the treatment of chronic cancer pain, but
individual responses can vary. This study compared the analgesic efficacy,
changes of therapy and safety profile over time of four strong opioids given for 
cancer pain.
PATIENT AND METHODS: In this four-arm multicenter, randomized, comparative, of
superiority, phase IV trial, oncological patients with moderate to severe pain
requiring WHO step III opioids were randomly assigned to receive oral morphine or
oxycodone or transdermal fentanyl or buprenorphine for 28 days. At each visit,
pain intensity, modifications of therapy and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were
recorded. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of nonresponders,
meaning patients with worse or unchanged average pain intensity (API) between the
first and last visit, measured on a 0-10 numerical rating scale. (NCT01809106).
RESULTS: Forty-four centers participated in the trial and recruited 520 patients.
Worst pain intensity and API decreased over 4 weeks with no significant
differences between drugs. Nonresponders ranged from 11.5% (morphine) to 14.4%
(buprenorphine). Appreciable changes were made in the treatment schedules over
time. Each group required increases in the daily dose, from 32.7% (morphine) to
121.2% (transdermal fentanyl). Patients requiring adjuvant analgesics ranged from
68.9% (morphine) to 81.6% (oxycodone), switches varied from 22.1% (morphine) to
12% (oxycodone), discontinuation of treatment from 27% ( morphine) to 14.5%
(fentanyl). ADRs were similar except for effects on the nervous system, which
significantly prevailed with morphine.
CONCLUSION: The main findings were the similarity in pain control, response rates
and main adverse reactions among opioids. Changes in therapy schedules were
notable over time. A considerable proportion of patients were nonresponders or
poor responders.

The rationale for putting opioid antagonists with an agonist is to improve pain
control, to reduce side effects, and/or to reduce abuse. The combination of
prolonged release (PR) oxycodone and naloxone reduces constipation as
demonstrated in multiple studies and has been designated a tamper-resistant
opioid by the Food and Drug Administration. Bioequivalence of the combination
product compared with PR oxycodone has not been established. Several of the
pivotal studies provided suboptimal laxative support in the control arm of the
randomized trials. Two noninferiority trials have demonstrated equivalent
analgesia between PR oxycodone and the combination product at doses of less than 
120 mg of oxycodone per day. There appears to be an analgesic ceiling above
80-120 mg of oxycodone per day. Safety monitoring during randomized trials was
not been well described in published manuscripts. Benefits appear to be better
for those with chronic noncancer pain compared with individuals with cancer when 
constipation was the primary outcome.

BACKGROUND: Rectus sheath block (RSB) is used for postoperative pain relief in
patients undergoing abdominal surgery with midline incision. Preoperative RSB has
been shown to be effective, but it has not been compared with postoperative RSB. 
The aim of the present study is to evaluate postoperative pain, sleep quality and
changes in the cytokine levels of patients undergoing gynaecological surgery with
RSB performed preoperatively versus postoperatively.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a prospective, randomised, controlled (randomised, 
parallel group, concealed allocation), single-blinded trial. All patients
undergoing transabdominal gynaecological surgery will be randomised 1:1 to the
treatment intervention with general anaesthesia as an adjunct to preoperative or 
postoperative RSB. The objective of the trial is to evaluate postoperative pain, 
sleep quality and changes in the cytokine levels of patients undergoing
gynaecological surgery with RSB performed preoperatively (n = 32) versus
postoperatively (n = 32). All of the patients, irrespective of group allocation, 
will receive patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) with oxycodone. The 
primary objective is to compare the interval between leaving the post-anaesthesia
care unit and receiving the first PCIA bolus injection on the first postoperative
night between patients who receive preoperative versus postoperative RSB. The
secondary objectives will be to compare (1) cumulative oxycodone consumption at
24 hours after surgery; (2) postoperative sleep quality, as measured using a
BIS-Vista monitor during the first night after surgery; and (3) cytokine levels
(interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ) during 
surgery and at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively.
DISCUSSION: Clinical experience has suggested that RSB is a very effective
postoperative analgesic technique, and we will answer the following questions
with this trial. Do preoperative block and postoperative block have the same
duration of analgesic effects? Can postoperative block extend the analgesic time?
The results of this study could have actual clinical applications that could help
to reduce postoperative pain and shorten hospital stays.

OBJECTIVE: The present study was performed to evaluate the effect of
postoperative administration of pregabalin in patients who reported
moderate-to-severe pain after epidural analgesia following thoracotomy.
DESIGN: An open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group study.
SETTING: A single center in Japan.
PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients (aged≥20 years) who reported
moderate-to-severe pain after effectual 2-day epidural analgesia post-thoracotomy
for lung cancer from February 2012 to March 2013.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned to 2 groups: control (control treatment:
acetaminophen, 400 mg, and codeine phosphate powder, 20 mg) or pregabalin
(pregabalin, 75 mg, plus control treatment). The 12-week study period included
2-week study treatment and 10-week follow-up.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For efficacy, the primary endpoint was the visual 
analog scale (VAS) scores for pain at rest and with coughing at week 2, and
secondary endpoints were the VAS scores for pain and the neuropathic pain
questionnaire at week 12. Fifty patients were randomized (25 per group). At week 
2, the VAS scores for pain at rest (mean [SD]) were 29.5 (21.9) in the control
group and 16.3 (15) in the pregabalin group (p = 0.02); for pain with coughing,
the scores were 45.2 (20.9) and 28.8 (25.9), respectively (p = 0.02). VAS scores 
improved more in the pregabalin group than in the control group over the 12
weeks. Patients free from possible neuropathic pain were 48% of the control group
and 88% of the pregabalin group, respectively (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative administration of pregabalin effectively reduced
post-thoracotomy pain.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the durability of pain relief provided by a new
formulation of single-entity, hydrocodone extended-release (ER) (Zohydro(®) ER)
throughout the 12-hour dosing interval by examining patterns of rescue medication
use.
DESIGN: Phase 3, enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal study with an
open-label, conversion/titration phase (≤6 weeks) followed by a
placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment phase (12 weeks).
SETTING: Fifty-seven study sites in the United States enrolled patients.
SUBJECTS: One hundred and fifty-one opioid-experienced subjects with moderate to 
severe chronic low back pain who were treated with hydrocodone ER once every 12
hours.
METHODS: Post hoc analysis of rescue medication use by frequency and distribution
of use following the morning and evening dose of hydrocodone ER.
RESULTS: No rescue medication was used following the morning or evening dose of
hydrocodone ER during 36.0% and 76.7% of the dosing days, respectively. Time
distribution of rescue medication use showed that 79.3% of all rescue medication 
doses were administered following the morning dose, with the highest rate of
usage (46.2%) occurring 4-8 hours postdose, followed by 18.7% and 14.4% usage 0-4
and 8-12 hours postdose, respectively. Examination of the three 4-hour intervals 
following the evening dose of hydrocodone ER revealed similar minimal rescue
medication use (5.6-8.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: End-of-dose failure was not observed based on the use of rescue
medication after administration of single-entity, twice daily, hydrocodone ER
capsules (Zohydro ER).

OBJECTIVES: Nefopam is a centrally-acting non-opioid analgesic, which has no
effect on bleeding time and platelet aggregation. There has been no study about
nefopam and oxycodone combination for postoperative analgesia. In this study, we 
present efficacy and side effects of nefopam/oxycodone compared with
ketorolac/oxycodone in patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) after gynecologic
surgery.
METHODS: 120 patients undergoing gynecologic surgery were divided randomly into
two groups: Nefopam group treated with oxycodone 1 mg and nefopam 1 mg bolus; and
Ketorolac group treated with oxycodone 1 mg and ketorolac 1.5 mg bolus. After the
operation, a blinded observer assessed the pain with a numeric rating scale
(NRS), infused PCA dose and sedation score at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h, nausea,
vomiting, headache, shivering, pruritus and delirium at 6, 24 and 48 h, and
satisfaction at 48 h after the operation.
RESULTS: Nefopam group showed less nausea than Ketorolac group within 6 h after
the operation. There were no significant differences in demographic data and
other complications between both groups. At 48 h after operation, satisfaction
and the infused PCA volumes of Nefopam group (34.0± 19.7 ml) showed no
significant differences compared to Ketorolac group (30.7± 18.4 ml, P-value=
0.46).
CONCLUSION: Nefopam showed a similar efficacy and lower incidence of nausea
within 6 h after the operation to that of ketorolac in PCA. Nefopam may be a
useful analgesic drug for the opioid-based PCA after gynecologic surgery. Further
evaluation of accurate equivalent dose of nefopam as well as pharmacokinetics of 
bolus administration is required.

BACKGROUND: Many patients with cancer experience moderate to severe pain that
requires treatment with strong opioids, of which oxycodone and morphine are
examples. Strong opioids are, however, not effective for pain in all patients,
nor are they well-tolerated by all patients. The aim of this review was to assess
whether oxycodone is associated with better pain relief and tolerability than
other analgesic options for patients with cancer pain.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and tolerability of oxycodone for pain in
adults with cancer.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process (Ovid), EMBASE 
(Ovid), Science Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science
(ISI Web of Science), BIOSIS (ISI), PsycINFO (Ovid) and PubMed to March 2014. We 
also searched Clinicaltrials.gov, metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), EU
Clinical Trials Register and World Health Organization International Clinical
Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We checked the bibliographic references of
relevant identified studies and contacted the authors of the included studies to 
find additional trials not identified by the electronic searches. No language,
date or publication status restrictions were applied to the search.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (parallel-group or
cross-over) comparing oxycodone (any formulation or route of administration) with
placebo or an active drug (including oxycodone) for cancer background pain in
adults.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted study data
(study design, participant details, interventions and outcomes) and independently
assessed the quality of the included studies according to standard Cochrane
methodology. Where possible, we meta-analysed the pain intensity data using the
generic inverse variance method, otherwise these data were summarised narratively
along with the adverse event and patient preference data. The overall quality of 
the evidence for each outcome was assessed according to the GRADE approach.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 17 studies which enrolled/randomised 1390 patients with
1110 of these analysed for efficacy and 1170 for safety. The studies examined a
number of different drug comparisons. Four studies compared controlled release
(CR) oxycodone to immediate release (IR) oxycodone and pooled analysis of three
of these studies showed that the effects of CR and IR oxycodone on pain intensity
after treatment were similar (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.1, 95%
confidence interval (CI) -0.06 to 0.26; low quality evidence). This was in line
with the finding that none of the included studies reported differences in pain
intensity between the treatment groups. Three of the four studies also found
similar results for treatment acceptability and adverse events in the IR and CR
groups; but one study reported that, compared to IR oxycodone, CR oxycodone was
associated with significantly fewer adverse events.Six studies compared CR
oxycodone to CR morphine and pooled analysis of five of these studies indicated
that pain intensity did not differ significantly between the treatments (SMD
0.14, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.32; low quality evidence). There were no marked
differences in adverse event rates, treatment acceptability or quality of life
ratings.The remaining seven studies either compared oxycodone in various
formulations or compared oxycodone to different alternative opioids. None of them
found any clear superiority or inferiority of oxycodone for cancer pain, neither 
as an analgesic agent nor in terms of adverse event rates and treatment
acceptability.The quality of this evidence base was limited by the risk of bias
of the studies and by small sample sizes for many outcomes. Random sequence
generation and allocation concealment were under-reported, and the results were
substantially compromised by attrition with data missing from more than 20% of
the enrolled/randomised patients for efficacy and from more than 15% for safety.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the data included within this review suggest that 
oxycodone offers similar levels of pain relief and adverse events to other strong
opioids including morphine, which is commonly considered the gold standard strong
opioid. Our conclusions are consistent with other recent reviews and suggest that
while the reliability of the evidence base is low, given the absence of important
differences within this analysis it seems unlikely that larger head to head
studies of oxycodone versus morphine will be justified. This means that for
clinical purposes oxycodone or morphine can be used as first line oral opioids
for relief of cancer pain.

OBJECTIVE: To observe treatment effects and safety of fluvoxamine combined with
oxycodone prolonged-release tablets in treating patients with moderate to severe 
cancer pain.
METHODS: Patients confirmed pathologically with cancer and complicated with
moderate to severe pain, were divided into control and experimental groups.
Oxycodone prolonged-release tablets, with or without fluvoxamine, were
administrated to all study patients until pain relief. Degree of pain relief,
dose of oxycodone prolonged-release tablets, side effects and quality of life
were compared before and after treatment.
RESULTS: In total, 120 patients were recruited. No statistically significant
difference was detected regarding age, gender, types of cancer, KPS between two
groups of patients (P> 0.05). Baseline pain score of patients with moderate pain 
in treatment and control group was 4.9±0.8 and 5.1±0.8, respectively; and
decreased to 1.8±1.1 and 1.2±1.1 after treatment, respectively. Pain intensity
was significantly reduced in the treatment group (P =0.028). Average daily
consumption of oxycodone prolonged- release tablets was (54.0±19.6) mg and (44.7±
18.7) mg respectively, which is lower in treatment grpup than in control group,
but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.065). Baseline pain
score of patients with severe pain in treatment and control groups were 8.3±1.1
and 8.3±1.1, respectively; and pain intensity after treatment decreased to
2.9±1.0 and 2.3±1.0. Pain intensity was significantly reduced in the treatment
group, with statistical significance (P =0.026). Average daily consumption of
oxycodone prolonged-release tablets was (132.0±42.2) mg and (110.7±33.9) mg,
respectively, which is lower in treatment group than in control group, and the
difference was statistically significant (P=0.035). In terms of quality of life, 
patients in treatment group had better performance status, daily activity, mood, 
and sleep than that in control group (P < 0.05). Patients in two groups had
similar side effects, eg., constipation, nausea/vomiting, lethargy, dizziness,
itchy skin, dysuria, and ataxia. Lower incidence of nausea/vomiting, lethargy,
was obtained from patients in treatment than in control group, while significant 
low constipation was observed in treatment than in control group (35.0% vs 49.2%,
P=0.026).
CONCLUSION: Fluvoxamine combined with oxycodone prolonged-release tablets could
be more effective in treating patients with cancer pain, and could reduce the
dosage of oxycodone prolonged-release tablets and thus be associated with lower
side effects, and improved quality of life.

Long-term evaluation of combined prolonged-release oxycodone and naloxone in
patients with moderate-to-severe chronic pain: pooled analysis of extension
phases of two Phase III trials.

BACKGROUND: While opioids provide effective analgesia, opioid-induced
constipation (OIC) can severely impact quality of life and treatment compliance. 
This pooled analysis evaluated the maintenance of efficacy and safety during
long-term treatment with combined oxycodone/naloxone prolonged-release tablets
(OXN PR) in adults with moderate-to-severe chronic pain.
METHODS: Patients (N = 474) received open-label OXN PR during 52-week extension
phases of two studies, having completed 12-week, double-blind, randomized
treatment with oxycodone prolonged-release tablets (Oxy PR) or OXN PR. Analgesia 
and bowel function were assessed at each study visit using 'Average pain over
last 24 h scale and Bowel Function Index (BFI), respectively. Treatment
Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication was assessed at study end only.
KEY RESULTS: Improvement in bowel function was particularly marked in patients
who switched from Oxy PR in the double-blind phase to OXN PR during the extension
phase, resulting in a clinically meaningful reduction (≥12 points) in BFI score: 
at the start of the extension phases, mean (SD) BFI score was 44.3 (28.13), and
was 29.8 (26.36) for patients who had received OXN PR in the double-blind phase. 
One week later, BFI scores were similar for the two groups (26.5 [24.40] and 27.5
[25.60], respectively), as was observed throughout the following months. Fewer
than 10% of patients received laxatives regularly. Mean 24-h pain scores were low
and stable throughout the extension phases. No unexpected adverse events were
observed.
CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Pooled data demonstrate OXN PR is an effective
long-term therapy for patients with chronic non-cancer pain, and can address
symptoms of OIC. No new safety issues were observed which were attributable to
the long-term administration of OXN PR.

Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE: The effects of combined oxycodone/naloxone prolonged release tablets
(OXN PR) were investigated in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic
cancer-related or non-cancer pain. All patients had opioid-induced constipation
(OIC) which persisted despite substantial laxative therapy.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This pooled analysis included 75 patients with OIC
at study entry that was refractory to at least two laxatives with different modes
of action. Patients completed randomized, double-blind treatment with OXN PR
20-120 mg/day for either 12 weeks (OXN 9001: non-cancer pain study) or 4 weeks
(OXN 2001: cancer-related pain study). Analgesia and bowel function were assessed
using the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form and Bowel Function Index (BFI),
respectively. Use of laxative medication and safety were assessed throughout the 
studies.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00513656, EudraCT 2005-002398-57, EudraCT
2005-003510-15.
RESULTS: Statistically and clinically significant improvements in bowel function 
were observed following double-blind treatment with OXN PR. Mean (SD) reduction
in BFI score was 21.2 (28.8) and comparable in patients with cancer-related (19.0
[28.9]) and non-cancer pain (23.3.[29.0]; P ≤ 0.0002). Furthermore, the
proportion of patients with a BFI score within normal range (≤28.8) increased
from 9.5% at screening to 43.1% at Day 15 of OXN PR. While all patients used ≥2
laxatives of different classes at screening, during study treatment 36% stopped
using laxatives (P < 0.001). OXN PR provided effective analgesia, evidenced by
stable pain scores during study treatment, and there were no unanticipated
adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: OXN PR significantly improved bowel function and reduced the use of 
laxatives in patients with OIC, previously unresponsive to at least two different
classes of laxatives. OXN also provided effective analgesia for patients with
moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain and non-cancer-related pain.

Codeine, alone and with paracetamol (acetaminophen), for cancer pain.

Straube C(1), Derry S, Jackson KC, Wiffen PJ, Bell RF, Strassels S, Straube S.

BACKGROUND: Pain is very common in patients with cancer. Opioid analgesics,
including codeine, play a significant role in major guidelines on the management 
of cancer pain, particularly for mild to moderate pain. Codeine is widely
available and inexpensive, which may make it a good choice, especially in
low-resource settings. Its use is controversial, in part because codeine is not
effective in a minority of patients who cannot convert it to its active
metabolite (morphine), and also because of concerns about potential abuse, and
safety in children.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and safety of codeine used alone or in
combination with paracetamol for relieving cancer pain.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 2), MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception 
to 5 March 2014, supplemented by searches of clinical trial registries and
screening of the reference lists of the identified studies and reviews in the
field.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought randomised, double-blind, controlled trials using
single or multiple doses of codeine, with or without paracetamol, for the
treatment of cancer pain. Trials could have either parallel or cross-over design,
with at least 10 participants per treatment group. Studies in children or adults 
reporting on any type, grade, and stage of cancer were eligible. We accepted any 
formulation, dosage regimen, and route of administration of codeine, and both
placebo and active controls.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently read the titles
and abstracts of all studies identified by the searches and excluded those that
clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria. For the remaining studies, two
authors read the full manuscripts and assessed them for inclusion. We resolved
discrepancies between review authors by discussion. Included studies were
described qualitatively, since no meta-analysis was possible because of the small
amount of data identified, and clinical and methodological between-study
heterogeneity.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 15 studies including 721 participants with cancer pain 
due to diverse types of malignancy. All studies were performed on adults; there
were no studies on children. The included studies were of adequate methodological
quality, but all except for one were judged to be at a high risk of bias because 
of small study size, and six because of methods used to deal with missing data or
high withdrawal rates. Three studies used a parallel group design; the remainder 
were cross-over trials in which there was an adequate washout period, but only
one reported results for treatment periods separately.Twelve studies used codeine
as a single agent and three combined it with paracetamol. Ten studies included a 
placebo arm, and 14 included one or more of 16 different active drug comparators 
or compared different routes of administration. Most studies investigated the
effect of a single dose of medication, while five used treatment periods of one, 
seven or 21 days. Most studies used codeine at doses of 30 mg to 120 mg.There
were insufficient data for any pooled analysis. Only two studies reported our
preferred responder outcome of 'participants with at least 50% reduction in pain'
and two reported 'participants with no worse than mild pain'. Eleven studies
reported treatment group mean measures of pain intensity or pain relief; overall 
for these outcome measures, codeine or codeine plus paracetamol was numerically
superior to placebo and equivalent to the active comparators.Adverse event
reporting was poor: only two studies reported the number of participants with any
adverse event specified by treatment group and only one reported the number of
participants with any serious adverse event. In multiple-dose studies nausea,
vomiting and constipation were common, with somnolence and dizziness frequent in 
the 21-day study. Withdrawal from the studies, where reported, was less than 10% 
except in two studies. There were three deaths, in all cases due to the
underlying cancer.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified only a small amount of data in studies that
were both randomised and double-blind. Studies were small, of short duration, and
most had significant shortcomings in reporting. The available evidence indicates 
that codeine is more effective against cancer pain than placebo, but with
increased risk of nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Uncertainty remains as to
the magnitude and time-course of the analgesic effect and the safety and
tolerability in longer-term use. There were no data for children.

AIM: To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of prolonged-release
oxycodone/naloxone (OXN PR) and its impact on quality of life (QoL), in patients 
with moderate-to-severe cancer pain.
METHODS: This was an open-label extension (OLE) of a 4 week, randomized,
double-blind (DB) study in which patients with moderate-to-severe cancer pain had
been randomized to OXN PR or oxycodone PR (OxyPR). During the OLE phase, patients
were treated with OXN PR capsules (≤ 20/60 mg/day) for ≤ 24 weeks. Outcome
measures included safety, efficacy and QoL.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients entered the OLE, average pain
scores based on the modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form were low and stable 
over the 24-week period. The improvement in bowel function and constipation
symptoms as measured by the Bowel Function Index and patient assessment of
constipation in patients treated with OXN PR during the 4-week DB study was
maintained. In patients treated with OxyPR during the DB phase, bowel function
and constipation symptoms were improved during the OLE. In the DB and in the OLE,
health status and QoL were similar for patients treated with OXN PR and OxyPR.
There were no unexpected safety or tolerability issues.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate-to-severe cancer pain, long-term use of
OXN PR is well tolerated and effective, resulting in sustained analgesia,
improved bowel function and improved symptoms of constipation.

Intermittent epidural vs continuous wound infusion of ropivacaine for acute and
chronic pain control after hysterectomy or myomectomy: a randomized controlled
trial.

(1)Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Aretaieio University Hospital,
Athens, Greece.

OBJECTIVE: Adequate postoperative analgesia may enhance recovery. The efficacy of
continuous wound infusion vs intermittent epidural ropivacaine for postoperative 
analgesia was investigated.
DESIGN: Prospective randomized, observer blind trial.
SETTING: Aretaieio University Hospital.
SUBJECTS: Patients scheduled for open abdominal hysterectomy or myomectomy.
METHODS: Patients received 10 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine along the skin incision
before skin closure, followed by wound infusion 2 mL/hour of 0.375% ropivacaine
or epidurally 10 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine in the beginning of surgery followed by 
10 mL of 0.2% ropivacaine 6 hourly. The epidural injections or the wound infusion
of ropivacaine lasted 48 hours. Rescue analgesia consisted of patient-controlled 
analgesia morphine up to 48 hours and acetaminophen/codeine tablets the next 24
hours. Analgesic consumption and visual analog scale pain at rest and during
cough were assessed 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively. One and three 
months later, patients were interviewed by phone for analgesic consumption at
home and presence of pain.
RESULTS: The subcutaneous group consumed more morphine during the first 2, 4, and
8 hours postoperatively (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively).
Subsequent morphine and acetaminophen/codeine requirements did not differ between
the two groups. Pain intensity during cough was higher only 2 hours after surgery
in the subcutaneous group (P = 0.002). Three months postoperatively, the two
groups did not differ in the analgesic requirements and presence of persisting
and/or burning pain.
CONCLUSION: Based on our results, there is no clinical significant difference
between the epidural ropivacaine and the subcutaneous ropivacaine group or a
clear superiority to one management strategy.

Clinical evaluation of the first oxycodone once daily prolonged release tablet in
moderate to severe chronic pain: a randomized, double-blind, multicenter,
cross-over, non-inferiority study to investigate efficacy and safety in
comparison with an established oxycodone twice daily prolonged release tablet.

OBJECTIVE: The first oxycodone once daily (OOD) has been developed and after
successful pharmacokinetic characterization, therapeutic efficacy and safety were
compared to an established oxycodone twice daily (OTD: Oxygesic/OxyContin,
Mundipharma).
DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, cross-over,
non-inferiority study was conducted in patients (n = 68) with chronic malignant
or non-malignant pain. The new OOD was compared to OTD at identical total daily
doses (TDD: 40-120 mg/day) employing intensive, five times daily current pain
(0-100 mm visual analog scale, VAS) and twice daily 12 h recalled pain
assessments as well as safety parameters such as nausea and sedation (VAS) over 5
days for each treatment (after a 5 day run-in phase).
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in analgesic potency detected
between the two treatments based on 95% CI for difference in the daily mean
current pain (-2.09 mm VAS) over 5 days, determined as -5.09 to 0.91 mm VAS. A
difference ≤12 mm VAS indicated non-inferiority of OOD, i.e. lack of clinically
relevant difference in analgesia. Intake of rescue medication had no effect on
study results as evaluated by ANCOVA. The difference in adverse events (AEs)
between the two treatments did not reach significance, as 19.1% and 23.5% of
patients experienced treatment-related AEs while on OOD and OTD, respectively.
Advantages for OOD regarding consistency of analgesia (i.e. use of rescue
medication, current and recalled pain) and sedation did not reach statistical
significance in this limited study population.
CONCLUSION: Despite the small number of patients and short study duration, the
results support the conclusion that new OOD is (at least) equivalent to
established OTD regarding safety and efficacy.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of preemptive oral oxycodone
with morphine patient-controlled anesthesia for postoperative pain management in 
patients undergoing uterine artery embolization for symptomatic uterine fibroids.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of oral premedication of oxycodone in
a group of patients undergoing elective uterine artery embolization under
sedation for fibroid disease.
METHODS: Thirty-nine patients (mean age 42.3 years) were prospectively randomized
1:1 to receive 20 mg oxycodone or placebo orally immediately before their
procedure. At the commencement of the procedure, patients were provided with a
patient-controlled analgesia device for 24 h, programmed to deliver 1 mg boluses 
of intravenous morphine with a 5 min lockout. Mean visual analog scale pain
intensity ratings (0-100 mm) were measured from both groups and evaluated over 0 
to 6 h as the primary end point. Other measured parameters included
opioid-related side effects and eligibility for discharge (NCT00163930; September
12, 2005).
RESULTS: Early pain intensity did not vary significantly between the active and
placebo groups [mean (standard deviation): 3.2 (2.5) vs. 3.1 (2.2), p = 0.89].
The oxycodone group, however, experienced significantly more nausea (p = 0.035)
and a greater incidence of vomiting (p = 0.044). Overall opioid requirement over 
24 h, measured as oral morphine equivalent, was greater in the oxycodone group
(median [interquartile range]: 64.5 [45-90] mg vs. 22.5 [15-46.5] mg, p <
0.0001). The number of patients first eligible for discharge at 24 h in the
oxycodone group was decreased but not significantly (p = 0.07).
CONCLUSION: The addition of preprocedural oral oxycodone to morphine
patient-controlled analgesia does not offer any analgesic advantage to patients
having uterine artery embolization and may cause a greater incidence of nausea
and vomiting.

CONTEXT: There is wide interindividual variation in response to morphine for
cancer-related pain; 30% of patients do not have a good therapeutic outcome.
Alternative opioids such as oxycodone are increasingly being used, and opioid
switching has become common clinical practice.
OBJECTIVES: To compare clinical response to oral morphine vs. oral oxycodone when
used as first-line or second-line (after switching) treatment in patients with
cancer-related pain.
METHODS: In this prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled trial
(ISRCTN65155201) with a selected crossover phase, patients with cancer-related
pain were randomized to receive either oral morphine or oxycodone as first-line
treatment. Dose was individually titrated until the patient reported adequate
pain control. Patients who did not respond to the first-line opioid (either
because of inadequate analgesia or unacceptable adverse effects) were switched to
the alternative opioid.
RESULTS: Two hundred patients were recruited. On intention-to-treat analysis
(n = 198, morphine 98, oxycodone 100), there was no significant difference
between the numbers of patients responding to morphine (61/98 = 62%) or oxycodone
(67/100 = 67%) when used as a first-line opioid. Similarly, there was no
significant difference in subsequent response when patients were switched to
either morphine (8/12 = 67%) or oxycodone (11/21 = 52%). Per-protocol analysis
demonstrated a 95% response rate when both opioids were available. There was no
difference in adverse reaction scores between morphine and oxycodone either in
first-line responders or nonresponders.
CONCLUSION: In this population, there was no difference between analgesic
response or adverse reactions to oral morphine and oxycodone when used as a
first- or second-line opioid. These data provide evidence to support opioid
switching to improve outcomes.

Noninferiority of the efficacy of once-daily hydromorphone hydrochloride
extended-release (hydromorphone ER) compared with twice-daily oxycodone
hydrochloride controlled-release (oxycodone CR) was investigated in this
randomized, double-blind study in Chinese patients with moderate to severe cancer
pain requiring strong oral opioid analgesics. Randomization (1:1) to
hydromorphone ER (8-32 mg) or oxycodone CR (10-40 mg) was followed by dose
titration (up to 8 days) and dose maintenance (28 days, weekly visits). Primary
endpoint was change from baseline to end of study in "worst pain in the past 24
hours" of Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) score on last observation carried
forward (per protocol set). A total of 137 of 260 randomized patients completed
maintenance phase (hydromorphone ER: n = 70; oxycodone CR: n = 67); per protocol 
set: 81 patients. Mean age was 53.1 years (range: 18-70 years; males: 65.3%);
most common Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status = 2. Least
square mean difference between 2 treatment groups for primary endpoint using
analysis of covariance (baseline score, covariate) was -.1 (95% confidence
interval: -1.3, 1.1), with upper bound of 95% confidence interval <1.5
(predefined noninferiority margin). Most common reason for deaths was disease
progression (hydromorphone ER: 6.3%; oxycodone CR: 12.7%). Treatment-emergent
adverse events were comparable between treatment groups. Hydromorphone ER was
noninferior to oxycodone CR in alleviating cancer pain and was well
tolerated.PERSPECTIVE: This article demonstrates clinical noninferiority of the
efficacy of once-daily hydromorphone ER compared with twice-daily oxycodone CR in
alleviating cancer pain in Chinese patients, with comparable safety profiles
between the 2 treatment groups. Thus, a treatment option with the potential for a
reduced dosing frequency exists for health care providers and patients.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The French Pain Society published guidelines for neuropathic
pain management in 2010. Our aim was to evaluate the compliance of GPs with these
guidelines three years later.
METHODS: We used "e" case vignette methodology for this non interventional study.
A national panel of randomly selected GPs was included. We used eight "e"
case-vignettes relating to chronic pain, differing in terms of the type of pain
(neuropathic/non neuropathic), etiology (cancer, postoperative pain, low back
pain with or without radicular pain, diabetes) and symptoms. GPs received two
randomly selected consecutive "e" case vignettes (with/without neuropathic pain).
We analyzed their ability to recognize neuropathic pain and to prescribe
appropriate first-line treatment.
RESULTS: From the 1265 GPs in the database, we recruited 443 (35.0%), 334 of whom
logged onto the web site (26.4%) and 319 (25.2%) of whom completed the survey.
Among these GPs, 170 (53.3%) were aware of the guidelines, 136 (42.6%) were able 
to follow them, and 110 (34.5%) used the DN4 diagnostic tool. Sensitivity for
neuropathic pain recognition was 87.8% (CI: 84.2%; 91.4%). However, postoperative
neuropathic pain was less well diagnosed (77.9%; CI: 69.6%; 86.2%) than diabetic 
pain (95.2%; CI: 90.0%; 100.0%), cancer pain (90.6%; CI: 83.5%; 97.8%) and
typical radicular pain (90.7%; CI: 84.9%; 96.5%). When neuropathic pain was
correctly recognized, the likelihood of appropriate first-line treatment
prescription was 90.6% (CI: 87.4%; 93.8%). The treatments proposed were
pregabaline (71.8%), gabapentine (43.9%), amiptriptylline (23.2%) and duloxetine 
(18.2%). However, ibuprofen (11%), acetaminophen-codeine (29.5%) and clonazepam
(10%) were still prescribed.
CONCLUSIONS: The compliance of GPs with clinical practice guidelines appeared to 
be satisfactory, but differed between etiologies.

and Health Psychology, University College London, UK.

BACKGROUND: The effects of opioid medication on cognitive functioning in patients
with cancer and non-cancer pain remain unclear.
METHOD: In this mechanistic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
cross-over study of patients (n = 20) receiving sustained-release and
immediate-release opioid medication as part of their palliative care, we examine 
memory effects of an additional dose of participants' immediate-release
medication (oxycodone or morphine) or placebo. Immediate prose recall and recall 
of related and unrelated word pairs was assessed pre-and post-drug (placebo or
immediate-release opioid). Memory for these stimuli was also tested after a delay
on each testing occasion. Finally, performance on an 'interference' word pair
task was assessed on the two testing occasions since proactive interference has
been posited as a mechanism for acute opioid-induced memory impairment.
RESULT: Unlike previous work, we found no evidence of memory impairment for
material presented before or after individually tailored, 'breakthrough' doses of
immediate-release opioid. Furthermore, immediate-release opioid did not result in
increased memory interference. On the other hand, we found enhanced performance
on the interference word pair task after immediate-release opioid, possibly
indicating lower levels of interference.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that carefully titrated immediate-release doses
of opioid drugs may not cause extensive memory impairment as previously reported,
and in fact, may improve memory in certain circumstances. Importantly, our
findings contrast strikingly with those of a study using the same robust design
that showed significant memory impairment. We propose that factors, such as
depressive symptoms, education level and sustained-release opioid levels may
influence whether impairment is observed following immediate-release opioid
treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of remifentanyl and propofol
injection in total intravenous anesthesia for percutaneous radiofrequency
ablation.
METHODS: 60 patients scheduled for PRFA were divided randomly into two
groups:group A and group B. Each group contained 30 patients. Those in group A
received remifentanyl and propofol injection, and the patients in group B were
given oxycodone hydrochloride. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) 
and pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2) were measured and recorded by monitor during
the operation. The chest muscle rigidity, respiratory depression, nausea and
vomitting, hypotensio and VAS were also recorded.
RESULTS: Compared with the preoperative,MAP, HR in group A decreased
significantly during the operation, increased in group B (P < 0.05). VAS was
significantly lower in group A than that in group B (P < 0.05). 2 patients had
respiratory depression, 1 patient had nausea and vomiting reaction in group A.2
patients had vagus reflex, 3 patient had nausea and vomitting reaction in group
B.
CONCLUSION: Total intravenous anesthesia with remifentanyl and propofol for PRFA 
is safe and reliable. Respiratory and circulation should be monitored instantly
and strictly.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain is a leading cause of disability and represents a
relevant societal burden. Opioids are widely used for managing chronic non-cancer
pain; however, the high incidence of side effects is often the main reason for
discontinuation. Two formulations have recently been studied to improve the
tolerability of opioids (tapentadol extended release [ER] and oxycodone/naloxone 
ER), but a direct comparison between these drugs is not available in the
literature. The comparative cost effectiveness of these two drugs has not
previously been assessed. The objective of this meta-analysis is a clinical and
economic evaluation of tapentadol ER and oxycodone/naloxone ER for the treatment 
of musculoskeletal pain, by indirect comparison with controlled release (CR)
oxycodone.
METHODS: A structured literature review was conducted to identify published data 
for the health-economic model. The authors performed a meta-analysis on three
selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for each treatment (tapentadol ER
and oxycodone/naloxone ER). As measure of treatment effect, risk ratio was
calculated, compared to the control active treatment (CR oxycodone), for the
following outcomes: discontinuation rate due to adverse events, due to
gastrointestinal (GE) side effects and central nervous system (CNS) side effects.
A Markov model was developed to compare the cost effectiveness of tapentadol ER
and oxycodone/naloxone ER. Four health states were defined: (1) patients still on
treatment; (2) occurrence of adverse events (gastroenterology, central nervous
system); (3) treatment discontinuation as consequence of ineffectiveness of
treatment; and (4) treatment discontinuation as consequence of adverse events.
RESULTS: Both drugs showed a significant clinical advantage over the active
control, CR oxycodone; however, tapentadol ER resulted in a better risk ratio
reduction for the primary outcome of discontinuation rate due to adverse events
and for the secondary outcome nausea and vomiting. The two drugs gave equivalent 
results in the capacity of reduction of constipation risk. In the economic
evaluation both interventions were cost effective compared with CR oxycodone.
However, tapentadol ER showed the most favorable results as in 65% of cases it
was less costly and produced a considerable quality adjusted life years (QALY)
gain. The higher impact of tapentadol ER on the cost effectiveness results was
probably due to the price and the lower incidence of adverse events and related
discontinuation rate, resulting in a further economic advantage.
CONCLUSION: Both tapentadol ER and oxycodone/naloxone ER are cost effective
interventions compared with CR oxycodone; however, tapentadol ER was shown to
provide better clinical outcomes at lower costs.

Oxycodone/Naloxone prolonged-release: a review of its use in the management of
chronic pain while counteracting opioid-induced constipation.

A combination of prolonged-release (PR) oxycodone with PR naloxone (Targin(®),
Targiniq(®), Targinact(®)) in one tablet with a fixed 2:1 ratio is available for 
the treatment of patients with severe pain, which can only be adequately managed 
with opioid analgesics. The aim of this formulation is to counteract
opioid-induced constipation through the local antagonist effect of naloxone in
the gut wall, while maintaining analgesia due to the low bioavailability of oral 
naloxone. Three large, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, phase III trials in
patients with moderate to severe, chronic, non-malignant pain, plus a
prospectively planned pooled analysis of two of these studies, demonstrated that 
oxycodone/naloxone PR improved bowel function, as measured by the bowel function 
index, compared with oxycodone PR. Additionally, oxycodone/naloxone PR relieved
pain more effectively than placebo and no less effectively than oxycodone PR
after 12 weeks. Phase II efficacy data in cancer patients are consistent with
those observed in patients with non-malignant pain. Oxycodone/naloxone PR was
generally well tolerated; the most frequently reported adverse events were of
gastrointestinal origin, consistent with those known to occur with opioid
therapy. Of note, numerically lower rates of constipation were observed in the
oxycodone/naloxone PR group compared with the oxycodone PR group. A cost-utility 
analysis predicted that oxycodone/naloxone PR would be a cost-effective option
compared with oxycodone PR in patients with non-malignant pain. Although more
comparative data are needed, oxycodone/naloxone PR is an effective option for use
in patients with severe chronic pain, particularly among those with
opioid-induced constipation.

Guidelines for opioid treatment of chronic non-malignant pain recommend
long-acting over short-acting opioid formulations. The evidence for this
recommendation is weak. This study is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy,
8-week comparison of long-acting dihydrocodeine tablets (DHC-Continus) with
short-acting dihydrocodeine tablets in 60 patients with chronic non-malignant
pain who were referred to a multidisciplinary pain clinic. All patients used
codeine-paracetamol tablets before the trial, and paracetamol was added in both
groups during the trial. The primary outcome was stability in pain intensity,
measured as the difference between the highest and least pain intensity reported 
on an 11-point numerical rating scale in a 7-day diary. The secondary outcomes
were differences in quality of life, quality of sleep, depression, and episodes
of breakthrough pain between the 2 formulations. Spontaneously reported adverse
events were recorded. In all, 38 patients completed the trial, and 22 withdrew
before the end. The reasons for withdrawal were adverse events, lack of efficacy,
or both, and were similar between the groups. There were no significant
differences in stability of pain intensity between groups. There were no
significant differences between groups in quality of sleep, depression,
health-related quality of life, or adverse events. Breakthrough pain was
experienced in both groups during the trial. Long-acting dihydrocodeine was not
observed to be superior for any of the outcomes in this trial. The results of
this study do not support current guidelines recommending long-acting opioids.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the association between clinical symptoms and
anatomical and functional cerebral deficits in codeine-containing cough syrups
(CCS) users using voxel-based morphometry and resting state functional
connectivity analysis.
METHODS: Participants were 30 CCS users and 30 matched controls. Both groups were
scanned using a volumetric three-dimensional fast field echo sequence and a
gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence. Impulsivity traits of both groups
were evaluated with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11 (BIS 11). Voxel-based
morphometry was used to characterize gray matter (GM) deficits in CCS users. The 
clinical significance of regional volume reduction was investigated by evaluating
its association with impulsivity in CCS users and with alterations in resting
state functional connectivity when brain regions with GM volume reduction were
used as seed areas.
RESULTS: Significantly decreased GM volume was observed in CCS users in bilateral
ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) which was related to greater impulsivity
in CCS users. Significantly decreased integration was found in CCS users between 
the vmPFC and the default mode network. Also, significantly enhanced functional
connectivity was found between the vmPFC and the right insula, and the right
dorsal lateral PFC. Negative correlation was observed between BIS total scores,
scores for attentional impulsivity and vmPFC-inferior parietal lobe connectivity 
in CCS users.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed volume loss and aberrant functional
organization in vmPFC among CCS users. In addition, the decreased vmPFC GM volume
and attenuated functional connectivity of the vmPFC-inferior parietal lobe
network were associated with clinical higher impulsivity trait in CCS users.

Transdermal fentanyl for cancer pain.

Hadley G(1), Derry S, Moore RA, Wiffen PJ.

Author information: 
(1)Pain Research and Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of
Oxford, Pain Research Unit, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, Oxfordshire, UK, OX3 7LE.

BACKGROUND: Opioid drugs have been used for many years to relieve pain.
Transdermal fentanyl offers one option for delivering and maintaining pain relief
in patients with moderate or severe cancer pain.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the analgesic efficacy of transdermal fentanyl for
relief of cancer pain, and to assess the adverse events associated with the use
of transdermal fentanyl for relief of cancer pain.
SEARCH METHODS: The following databases were searched: Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 4 of 12);
MEDLINE (1966 to May 2013); EMBASE (1974 to May 2013; CANCERLIT (PubMED)
(November 2012); and ClinicalTrials.gov (May 2013).
SELECTION CRITERIA: Published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using placebo
or active comparators reporting on the analgesic effect of transdermal fentanyl
in adults and children with cancer pain. Studies with fewer than 10 participants 
were excluded.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted independently by two review
authors. We extracted any available data on the number or proportion of patients 
with 'no worse than mild pain' or treatment success (very satisfied, or very good
or excellent on patient global impression scales), together with information
about adverse events and withdrawals.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified nine studies meeting the inclusion criteria,
including a Turkish study that is awaiting formal translation. There were 1244
participants randomised in classically designed RCTs, of whom 1197 had evaluable 
data, and 138 patients enrolled in an enriched enrolment, randomised withdrawal
(EERW) trial. Overall, 600 participants were treated with transdermal fentanyl
patches, 382 with various formulations of morphine, 36 with methadone, and 221
with paracetamol plus codeine. There were major sources of potential bias,
including lack of blinding, small size, high levels of attrition, and
inconsistent reporting.We could not compare data in a meaningful analysis
regarding adverse events such as nausea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal
bleeding, and confusion. These events may have been attributable to the
underlying disease process.There were insufficient comparable data for
meta-analysis to be undertaken or to produce numbers needed to treat (NNT) for
the analgesic effect. In seven studies with 461 participants reporting pain
intensity results after about two weeks, the mean or median pain scores were on
the borderline of mild and moderate pain. Most participants would have had no
worse than mild pain on treatment. Another reported that 77% of participants
using transdermal fentanyl had an undefined successful outcome. Fewer
participants experienced constipation with transdermal fentanyl (28%) than with
oral morphine (46%), giving a risk ratio of 0.61 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.78); the NNT
to prevent constipation was 5.5 (95% CI 3.8 to 10).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The randomised trial literature for effectiveness of
transdermal fentanyl is limited, but it is an important medicine. Most studies
recruited fewer than 100 participants and did not provide data appropriate for
meta-analysis. Only a few reported how many patients had good pain relief but,
where data were reported, a majority had no worse than mild pain within a
reasonably short time period. The evidence pointed to a useful and significant
reduction in complaints about constipation for transdermal fentanyl compared with
oral morphine.

Oxycodone/naloxone in the management of patients with pain and opioid-induced
bowel dysfunction.

Sciences, Osiedle Rusa 25 A, 61 - 245 Poznan, Poland. wojciechleppert@wp.pl.

INTRODUCTION: Common opioids adverse effects include opioid-induced bowel
dysfunction (OIBD), which comprises opioid-induced constipation, dry mouth,
nausea, vomiting, gastric stasis, bloating, and abdominal pain. Traditional
laxatives which are often prescribed for the prevention and treatment of OIBD
possess limited efficacy and display adverse effects. A targeted approach to OIBD
management is the use of a combination of an opioid agonist with opioid receptor 
antagonist or administration of purely peripherally acting opioid receptor
antagonists.
METHODS: A literature search with terms "oxycodone/naloxone" in the PubMed and
MEDLINE database updated on 31(st) July 2013. All studies of oxycodone/naloxone
(randomized, controlled trials and open, uncontrolled studies) were included. In 
addition, studies on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxycodone/naloxone 
were included.
RESULTS: A combination of prolonged-release oxycodone with prolonged-release
naloxone (OXN) in one tablet with a fixed 2:1 ratio provides effective analgesia 
with limited disturbing effect on bowel function. Oxycodone is a valued opioid
administered either as the first strong opioid or when other strong opioids have 
been ineffective. Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist that displays local
antagonist effect on opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and is nearly
completely inactivated in the liver after oral administration. As demonstrated in
controlled studies conducted in patients with chronic non-malignant and
cancer-related pain OXN in daily doses up to 80 mg/40 mg provided equally
effective analgesia with an improved bowel function compared to oxycodone
administered alone.
CONCLUSION: OXN is an important drug for chronic pain management, prevention and 
treatment of OIBD.

Fentanyl buccal tablet compared with immediate-release oxycodone for the
management of breakthrough pain in opioid-tolerant patients with chronic cancer
and noncancer pain: a randomized, double-blind, crossover study followed by a
12-week open-label phase to evaluate patient outcomes.

(1)CRI Lifetree, Salt Lake City, Utah.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate analgesic efficacy, functional benefit, and patient
satisfaction with fentanyl buccal tablet vs immediate-release oxycodone for
breakthrough pain (BTP).
DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, active-controlled crossover trial and 12-week
open-label extension.
SETTING: Forty-two U.S. sites.
PATIENTS: Opioid-tolerant patients with predominantly chronic noncancer pain
experiencing BTP.
INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to open-label titration periods with
fentanyl buccal tablet followed by oxycodone or vice versa for BTP management.
After titrating to a successful dose of both medications (single dose providing
adequate analgesia without unacceptable adverse events), patients were
re-randomized to treat 10 BTP episodes with one medication and 10 with the other.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy measure was pain intensity (PI) difference
15 minutes postdose. Secondary measures included PI difference 5, 10, 30, 45, and
60 minutes postdose; sum of PI differences 30 and 60 minutes postdose; ≥33% and
≥50% reduction in PI; and pain relief. Questionnaires assessed functional
status/satisfaction.
RESULTS: Of 213 patients enrolled, 149 achieved a successful dose of both
medications; 131 completed the double-blind phase and 112 the open-label phase.
PI difference at 15 minutes (mean [standard deviation]) was greater with fentanyl
buccal tablet (0.88 [1.20]) vs oxycodone (0.76 [1.13]; P < 0.001). Patients
preferred fentanyl buccal tablet (47%) over oxycodone (35%); 18% had no
preference. Patients and clinicians reported consistently better functional
improvement and satisfaction with fentanyl buccal tablet vs short-acting opioids 
(P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Fentanyl buccal tablet was associated with rapid onset of analgesia 
and improvements in functional status and patient satisfaction compared with
immediate-release oxycodone.

PURPOSE: Neuropathic pain is commonly associated with cancer. Current treatments 
include combination opioid and adjuvant therapies, but no guidelines are
available for dose escalation strategies. This phase II study compared the
efficacy and tolerability of two dose escalation strategies for oxycodone and
pregabalin combination therapy.
METHODS: Patients (N = 75) with oncological neuropathic pain, previously
untreated with pregabalin, were recruited in 5 Italian institutions between 2007 
and 2010. Patients were randomised to two different dose escalation strategies
(arm A; N = 38) oxycodone at a fixed dose with increasing pregabalin doses; (arm 
B; N = 37) pregabalin at a fixed dose with increasing oxycodone doses. Patients
were evaluated from daily diaries and follow-ups at 3, 7, 10, and 14 days after
beginning treatment with a numerical rating scale (NRS), neuropathic pain scale
(SDN), and well-being scale (ESAS). The primary endpoint was a ≥1/3 reduction in 
pain (NRS); secondary endpoints included the time to analgesia and adverse
effects. The study had a 90% probability of detecting the best strategy for a
true difference of at least 15%.
RESULTS: More patients in arm A (76%) than arm B (64%) achieved ≥1/3 overall pain
reduction even after controlling for baseline factors (gender, baseline pain).
Group A reported fewer side effects than group B; constipation 52.8% vs. 66.7%;
nausea: 27.8% vs. 44.4%; drowsiness: 44.4% vs. 55.6%; confusion: 16.7% vs. 27.8%;
itching: 8.3% vs. 19.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: Both strategies effectively controlled neuropathic pain, but
according to the adopted selection design arm A is preferable to arm B for pain
control.

INTRODUCTION: A mu receptor antagonist combined with oxycodone (OXY) may improve 
pain control, reduce physical tolerance and withdrawal, minimizing opioid-related
bowel dysfunction and act as an abuse deterrent.
AREAS COVERED: The authors cover the use of OXY plus ultra-low-dose naltrexone
for analgesia and the use of sustained-release OXY plus sustained-release
naloxone to reduce the opioid bowel syndrome. The authors briefly describe the
use of sustained-release OXY and naltrexone pellets as a drug abuse deterrent
formulation. Combinations of ultra-low-dose naltrexone plus OXY have been in
separate trials involved in patients with chronic pain from osteoarthritis and
idiopathic low back pain. High attrition and marginal differences between
ultra-low-dose naltrexone plus OXY and OXY led to discontinuation of development.
Prolonged-release (PR) naloxone combined with PR OXY demonstrates a consistent
reduction in opioid-related bowel dysfunction in multiple randomized controlled
trials. However, gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea, were
increased in several trials with the combination compared with PR OXY alone.
Analgesia appeared to be maintained although non-inferiority to PR OXY is not
formally established. There were flaws to trial design and safety monitoring.
Naltrexone has been combined with OXY in individual pellets encased in a capsule.
This combination has been reported in a Phase II trial and is presently
undergoing Phase III studies.
EXPERT OPINION: Due to the lack of efficacy the combination of altered low-dose
naltrexone with oxycodone should cease in development. The combination of
sustained release oxycodone plus naloxone reduces constipation with a consistent 
benefit. Safety has been suboptimally evaluated which is a concern. Although the 
drug is commercially available in several countries, ongoing safety monitoring
particularly high doses would be important.

BACKGROUND: Targiniq®, an oxycodone prolonged-release (PR) formulation combined
with the opioid antagonist naloxone PR, aims to prevent opioid-induced
constipation without impairing the analgesic efficacy. This has been confirmed
during prolonged use in chronic pain or cancer patients. The purpose of our study
was to compare clinical effects of oxycodone PR with oxycodone PR + naloxone PR
for short-term post-operative pain management.
METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, prospective study included 85 women
undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy. The two groups received either oxycodone PR
10 mg or oxycodone PR 10 mg + naloxone PR 5 mg as pre-medication and twice daily 
for 3 days. As rescue analgesic, the patients received oxycodone intravenous
during the first 24 h post-operatively and oxycodone tablets in the 24-72-h
period. Constipation, other side effects, pain and satisfaction were registered
during the first 7 post-operative days.
RESULTS: Demographic, pre- and perioperative variables and the use of rescue
analgesics were similar in the groups. There were no significant differences in
variables related to constipation. In the oxycodone PR + naloxone PR group, 25%
had no defecation during the first 72 h post-operatively, compared with 20% in
the oxycodone PR group (mean 1.2 ± 1.1 vs. 2.1 ± 2.4 defecations). Other
opioid-induced effects and side effects showed no significant differences. Only
7% were dissatisfied with their oral pain treatment.
CONCLUSION: Addition of naloxone to oxycodone PR tablets in a pain regimen
administered twice daily the first three post-operative days had no significant
clinical effects on constipation or other variables during the first week after
hysterectomy.

Correlation between the administration of morphine or oxycodone and the
development of infections in patients with cancer pain.

Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Japan.

Morphine and oxycodone are widely used in the therapy for cancer pain. Although
some previous studies have reported that morphine induces immunosuppression and
oxycodone does not, whether this is true for human infections is unclear. We
performed a retrospective study on the correlation between the administration of 
morphine or oxycodone and the development of infections in patients with cancer
pain. This study was undertaken in 841 inpatients receiving only 1 opioid
continuously for more than 10 days. Development of infections was based on (1)
antibiotic administration and (2) diagnosis of infections, positive microbial
culture test, or increase in white blood cells or C-reactive protein. Liver,
kidney, and hematological cancer, antineoplastic drugs, radiotherapy, steroid,
immunosuppressive agents, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and thyroid
inhibitors were defined as the exclusion criteria in consideration of influence
on immune system or metabolism and excretion of morphine and oxycodone. A total
of 60 morphine and 74 oxycodone cases were included, which resulted in 18 and 10 
infection cases. Significantly more patients treated with morphine developed
infections than those patients treated with oxycodone (odds ratio = 3.60, 95%
confidence interval = 1.40-9.26). No significant differences were seen in the
other variables analyzed. Although perhaps some confounding variables were
included because this was an observational rather than randomized study, these
results suggested that morphine's immunosuppressive effect may contribute to the 
development of infections in patients with cancer pain.

Clinical simulation model of long-acting opioids for treatment of chronic
non-cancer pain in the United States.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate costs and outcomes associated with initial tapentadol ER
vs oxycodone CR for the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) in the US.
METHODS: This study developed a Monte-Carlo simulation based on the scientific
foundation established by published models of long-acting opioids (LAO) in
patients having moderate-to-severe CNCP. It estimates costs and outcomes
associated with the use of tapentadol ER vs oxycodone CR over a 1-year period
from the perspective of a US payer. LAO effectiveness and treatment-emergent
adverse event (TEAE) rates are derived from clinical trials of tapentadol ER vs
oxycodone CR; other inputs are based on published literature supplemented
sparingly with clinical opinion. Sensitivity analyses consider the impact of
real-world dosing patterns for LAO on treatment costs.
RESULTS: Initial tapentadol ER consistently demonstrates better outcomes than
initial oxycodone CR (proportion of patients achieving adequate pain relief and
no GI TEAE; acute TEAE-free days; days free of chronic constipation;
quality-adjusted life days; productive working hours). While total costs with
initial tapentadol ER are slightly (2.2%) higher than with initial oxycodone CR, 
nearly twice as many modeled patients in the initial tapentadol ER arm (29% vs
15%) achieve adequate pain relief and no GI TEAE compared to initial oxycodone
CR. In sensitivity analyses, tapentadol ER becomes a dominant strategy when
real-world dosing patterns are considered.
CONCLUSION: The additional costs to produce better outcomes (pain relief and no
GI TEAE) associated with tapentadol ER are small in the context of double the
likelihood of a patient response with tapentadol ER. When daily average
consumption (DACON) for oxycodone CR is factored into the analysis, initial
tapentadol ER becomes a dominant strategy. Our findings are both strengthened,
and limited by the use of randomized trial-centric input parameters. These
results should be validated as inputs from clinical practice settings become
available.

Lack of association between genetic variability and multiple pain-related
outcomes in a large cohort of patients with advanced cancer: the European
Pharmacogenetic Opioid Study (EPOS).

Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether the choice of pain-related outcome to
represent opioid efficacy influenced findings in a genetic association study.
Data from the European Pharmacogenetic Opioid Study, which used opioid dose as
the outcome, were analysed in respect of six alternative outcomes: average pain
intensity, pain right now, worst pain intensity, pain at its least, pain relief
and pain interference.
DESIGN: Cancer pain patients using an opioid for moderate or severe pain were
included. The pain outcomes were obtained using the Brief Pain Inventory. Genetic
variation was analysed for 112 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 25
candidate genes relevant for opioid efficacy. The patients were randomly divided 
into a development and a validation sample and linear regression was used to
compare the equality of means in the six outcomes. The influence of non-genetic
factors was controlled for, the regression analyses were stratified by country,
and the results were corrected for multiple testing.
RESULTS: 2201 cancer pain patients were included. Their mean age was 62.4 years
and mean average pain was 3.5. None of the examined SNPs exceeded p values
corrected for multiple testing for any of the outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: None of the outcomes were associated with variation in the selected 
SNPs, as previously shown for opioid dose. Thus, we observed that findings
related to associations between genetic variability and opioid efficacy were
consistent for several alternative outcomes.

Efficacy and tolerability of oxycodone in moderate-severe cancer-related pain: A 
meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Wang YM(1), Liu ZW, Liu JL, Zhang L.

Author information: 
(1)Departments of Hospice, and.

In order to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of oxycodone in
moderate-severe cancer-related pain, we conducted a systematic review of
randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Publications addressing the efficacy and
tolerability of oxycodone in moderate-severe cancer-related pain were selected
from the Cochrane library, PubMed, Embase and CBM databases. Data were extracted 
from the studies by two independent reviewers. The meta-analysis was performed by
RevMan 5.0.25 and STATA 9.2 software. From these data, odds ratios (ORs) or the
standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
calculated. Finally, only seven RCTs were retrieved with a total of 613 cancer
patients with moderate-severe pain. The meta-analysis results showed that
oxycodone was statistically superior to other strong opioids based on pain
intensity scores following intervention [weighted mean difference (WMD), 0.25;
95% CI, 0.05-0.45; P=0.01; WMD, -1.30; 95% CI, -1.55-1.05; P<0.001,
respectively]. In addition, there were statistically significant differences
between oxycodone and other strong opioids in cancer-related pain on the obvious 
effective rate and the overall effective rate (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.40-2.95;
P=0.0002; OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.09-3.44; P=0.02, respectively). Compared with other
strong opioids, nausea and constipation occurred significantly less frequently
with the use of oxycodone for cancer-related pain (OR=0.52, 95% CI=0.32-0.85,
P=0.009; OR= 0.55, 95% CI= 0.35-0.87, P= 0.01; respectively). In conclusion, this
meta-analysis confirms that the efficacy and tolerability of oxycodone are
superior to those of other strong opioids, including morphine sulfate, codeine
and tramadol, supporting its use as an opioid for cancer-related pain.

Pain Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-0409, USA. dkoyyala@mdanderson.org

BACKGROUND: In all recommended guidelines put forth for the treatment of cancer
pain, opioids continue to be an important part of a physician's armamentarium.
Though opioids are used regularly for cancer pain, there is a paucity of
literature proving efficacy for long-term use. Cancer is no longer considered a
"terminal disease"; 50% to 65% of patients survive for at least 2 years, and
there are about 12 million cancer survivors in the United States. There is a
concern about side effects, tolerance, abuse and addiction with long-term opioid 
use and a need to evaluate the effectiveness of opioids for cancer pain.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to look at the
effectiveness of opioids for cancer pain.
STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of randomized trials of opioids for cancer
pain.
METHODS: A comprehensive review of the current literature for randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) of opioids for cancer pain was done. The literature
search was done using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, clinical trials, national
clearing house, Web of Science, previous narrative systematic reviews, and cross 
references. The studies were assessed using the modified Cochrane and Jadad
criteria. Analysis of evidence was done utilizing the modified quality of
evidence developed by United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain relief was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome 
measures are quality of life (QoL) and side effects including tolerance and
addiction.
RESULTS: The level of evidence for pain relief based on the USPSTF criteria was
fair for transdermal fentanyl and poor for morphine, tramadol, oxycodone,
methadone, and codeine.
LIMITATIONS: Randomized trials in a cancer setting are difficult to perform and
justify. There is a paucity of long-term trials and this review included a
follow-up period of only 4 weeks.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review of RCTs of opioids for cancer pain showed fair
evidence for the efficacy of transdermal fentanyl and poor evidence for morphine,
tramadol, oxycodone, methadone, and codeine.

A randomized, controlled trial comparing acetaminophen plus ibuprofen versus
acetaminophen plus codeine plus caffeine (Tylenol 3) after outpatient breast
surgery.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery, Dalhousie University and Capital District Health
Authority, Halifax, NS, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The combination of acetaminophen, codeine, and caffeine (Tylenol 3,
T3) is a standard postoperative analgesia after breast surgery despite the
adverse effects and variable efficacy of narcotics. This study compared the
efficacy of a nonnarcotic approach (acetaminophen and ibuprofen; AcIBU) to T3
after outpatient breast surgery.
METHODS: This double-blind randomized equivalence trial involved patients
undergoing outpatient breast surgery. Patients were randomized (stratified by
procedure type) to receive AcIBU or T3 four times daily for 7 days, or until free
of pain. Pain intensity, measured four times daily by the visual analog scale,
was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes were pain relief with analgesic, days
until freedom from pain, adverse effects, discontinuation of drug as a result of 
adverse effects, and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS: There were 71 patients randomized to AcIBU and 70 patients to T3.
Repeated measures analysis showed no significant difference in average pain
intensity over 7 days (AcIBU 19.9 mm vs. T3 20.6 mm; P = 0.78). Similarly, there 
was no significant difference in pain relief with analgesic (P = 0.46). Although 
no difference in the incidence of adverse effects was observed (P = 0.94),
discontinuation of the study drug as a result of adverse effects was more common 
with T3 (19 % vs. 6 %; P = 0.018). No significant differences were identified in 
days until freedom from pain or patient satisfaction; 92 % of AcIBU and 89 % of
T3 patients were satisfied with their pain control (P = 0.55).
CONCLUSIONS: AcIBU is a safe, effective method of pain control after outpatient
breast surgery. Compared to T3, it provides at least equivalent analgesia and has
a more tolerable adverse effect profile.

Serum concentrations of opioids when comparing two switching strategies to
methadone for cancer pain.

Author information: 
(1)Pain and Palliation Research Group, Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian University 
of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway. kristin.moksnes@ntnu.no

PURPOSE: Our aim was to compare pharmacological aspects of two switching
strategies from morphine/oxycodone to methadone; the stop and go (SAG) strategy
in which methadone is started directly after the initial opioid has been stopped,
and the 3-days switch (3DS), in which morphine/oxycodone is gradually changed to 
methadone by cross-tapering over 3 days.
METHODS: Forty-two cancer patients with pain and/or opioid side effects were
assessed in this randomised trial. Trough serum concentrations of methadone,
morphine, morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), and oxycodone were measured on days 1, 2,
3, 4, 7, and 14. Primary outcome was number of patients with methadone
concentrations in apparent C(SS) on day 4. Secondary outcomes were exposure to
opioids during the first 3 days, interindividual variation of opioid
concentrations, and correlation between methadone concentrations and pain
intensity (PI) day 3.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients received methadone (16 in the SAG group, 19 in the 
3DS group). The median preswitch morphine equivalent doses were 620 (range
350-2000) mg/day in the SAG group and 800 (range 90-3600) mg/day in the 3DS group
(p = 0.43);42% reached C(SS) for methadone in the SAG group on day 4 compared
with 22% in the 3DS group (p = 0.42). The SAG group was significantly less
exposed to morphine/M6G/oxycodone and significantly more exposed to methadone in 
the first 3 days. Methadone showed a low correlation with PI. More patients
dropped out after intervention in the SAG group than in the 3DS group (38% vs.
5%; p = 0.032). One SAG patient suffered from respiratory depression on day 5.
CONCLUSION: The SAG group was initially more exposed to methadone and less to the
replaced opioids but without observed clinical benefit and with a higher dropout 
rate. Patients switched to methadone should be followed closely for the first 5
days, regardless of switching strategy.

Buprenorphine 5, 10 and 20 μg/h transdermal patch: a guide to its use in chronic 
non-malignant pain.

Buprenorphine lower-dose (5, 10 and 20 μg/h) transdermal patches, which are
administered once every 7 days, are indicated in the management of chronic
non-malignant pain. This review focuses on the labelling of this formulation
(BuTrans®) in the EU. The analgesic efficacy of transdermal buprenorphine in
patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee has been demonstrated to be
equivalent to sublingual buprenorphine, noninferior to prolonged-release tramadol
and generally superior to a matching transdermal placebo patch. When used
together with regularly scheduled oral paracetamol (acetaminophen), transdermal
buprenorphine was noninferior to codeine plus paracetamol. Transdermal
buprenorphine has also shown analgesic efficacy in patients with chronic
non-malignant pain of various causes.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Interventional Radiology, Fudan University, Shanghai Medical
College, Zhongshan Hospital, 180 Fenglin Rd, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic
of China.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the analgesic effect, safety, and cost-effectiveness of
controlled-release oxycodone (CRO) to control postoperative pain in patients with
liver cancer who are undergoing transarterial chemoembolization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
prospective clinical study received institutional review board approval. After
written informed consent was obtained, 210 patients with liver cancer were
randomized into three groups of 70 patients. Group 1 received 20 mg of CRO, group
2 received 10 mg of CRO, and group 3 received a placebo at 1 hour before
transarterial chemoembolization (T(0)) and 12 (T(12)) and 24 (T(24)) hours after 
T(0). Pain intensity on a numeric rating scale, percentage of patients with each 
degree of pain, quality of life, adverse reactions, analgesic costs, and hospital
stays were evaluated and compared among the three groups.
RESULTS: Numeric rating scale scores for pain intensity in group 1 and group 2
were significantly lower than those in group 3 at T(0-12) (P < .001); T(12-24) (P
< .001); and T(24-48) (P < .001). When group 1 with group 2 were compared,
numeric rating scale scores were significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2
during the period of T(0-12) (P < .001) but were not significantly different at
T(12-24) (P = .68) and T(24-48) (P = .10). Analgesic cost and hospital stay were 
significantly lower in treated groups than in the placebo group. No significant
difference was observed in quality of life and adverse events between the treated
groups and the placebo group.
CONCLUSION: CRO is effective, safe, and cost-effective in the control of
postoperative pain after transarterial chemoembolization for patients with
inoperable liver cancer.

Buprenorphine 5, 10 and 20 μg/h transdermal patch: a review of its use in the
management of chronic non-malignant pain.

Plosker GL(1).

Author information: 
(1)Adis, a Wolters Kluwer Business, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.co.nz

This article reviews the pharmacology, therapeutic efficacy and tolerability
profile of the 7-day lower-dose (5, 10 and 20 μg/h) buprenorphine transdermal
patch (BuTrans®, Norspan®) in the management of chronic non-malignant pain, with 
a focus on European labelling for the drug. Buprenorphine is a semi-synthetic
opioid analgesic that acts primarily as a partial agonist at the mu opioid
receptor. The transdermal formulation provides continuous delivery of
buprenorphine, resulting in relatively consistent plasma drug concentrations
throughout the 7-day dosing interval. The analgesic efficacy of transdermal
buprenorphine in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee has been
demonstrated in several randomized controlled trials, which have shown the
formulation to be equivalent to sublingual buprenorphine, noninferior to
prolonged-release tramadol tablets, noninferior to codeine plus paracetamol
(acetaminophen) combination tablets (when transdermal buprenorphine was used
together with regularly scheduled oral paracetamol) and generally superior to a
matching transdermal placebo patch. Transdermal buprenorphine was significantly
more effective than placebo in reducing chronic low back pain of at least
moderate severity in two randomized, double-blind, crossover trials. Other
clinical trials, including a randomized, double-blind, maintenance-of-analgesia
study, have also demonstrated the analgesic efficacy of transdermal buprenorphine
in patients with chronic non-malignant pain of various causes. In general,
serious adverse events with transdermal buprenorphine are similar to those for
other opioid analgesics. Transdermal buprenorphine has a ceiling effect for
respiratory depression, and the main risk is when it is combined with other CNS
depressants. The most frequently reported adverse events with transdermal
buprenorphine are headache, dizziness, somnolence, constipation, dry mouth,
nausea, vomiting, pruritus, erythema, application site pruritus and application
site reactions. Transdermal buprenorphine was better tolerated than sublingual
buprenorphine in a 7-week, randomized, double-blind trial in patients with
osteoarthritis pain. Nevertheless, as with other opioids, persistence with
transdermal buprenorphine therapy is difficult for many patients because of
adverse events or other reasons. Thus, transdermal buprenorphine has generally
demonstrated good efficacy and tolerability in clinical trials in chronic
non-malignant pain, providing effective background analgesia as part of pain
management strategies for patients with osteoarthritis, low back pain and other
persistent pain syndromes of at least moderate severity. It also has favourable
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, which have beneficial clinical
implications, most notably the convenience of once-weekly administration and no
need for dosage adjustments in the elderly or those with compromised renal
function, making it an opioid of choice in these patients, and a useful
therapeutic option overall in the management of chronic non-malignant pain.

OBJECTIVE: An examination of whether oxycodone/naloxone prolonged-release tablets
(OXN PR) can improve constipation and maintain analgesia, compared with oxycodone
prolonged-release tablets (OxyPR) in patients with moderate/severe cancer pain.
METHODS: Randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, double-dummy,
parallel-group study in which 185 patients were randomized to receive up to 120
mg/day of OXN PR or OxyPR over 4 weeks. Efficacy assessments included Bowel
Function Index (BFI), Brief Pain Inventory Short-Form (BPI-SF), laxative and
rescue medication use. Quality of life (QoL) and safety assessments were
conducted.
RESULTS: After 4 weeks, mean BFI score was significantly lower with OXN PR; mean 
total laxative intake was 20% lower with OXN PR. Mean BPI-SF scores were similar 
for both treatments and the average rate of analgesic rescue medication use was
low and comparable. QoL assessments were stable and comparable with greater
improvements in constipation-specific QoL assessments with OXN PR. Overall, rates
of adverse drug reactions were similar.
CONCLUSIONS: OXN PR provides superior bowel function in cancer pain patients,
compared with OxyPR, without compromising analgesic efficacy or safety. This
study confirms that OXN PR is well tolerated and efficacious in cancer pain
patients and results are in line with those seen in non-malignant pain patients.

AIM: Opioid switching is a treatment strategy in cancer patients with
unacceptable pain and/or adverse effects (AEs). We investigated whether patients 
switched to methadone by the stop and go (SAG) strategy have lower pain intensity
(PI) than the patients switched over three days (3DS), and whether the SAG
strategy is as safe as the 3DS strategy.
METHODS: In this prospective, open, parallel-group, multicentre study, 42 cancer 
patients on morphine or oxycodone were randomised to the SAG or 3DS
switching-strategy to methadone. The methadone dose was calculated using a
dose-dependent ratio. PI, AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded
daily for 14 days. Primary outcome was average PI day 3. Secondary outcomes were 
PI now and AEs day 3 and 14 and number of SAEs.
RESULTS: Twenty one patients were randomised to each group, 16 (SAG) and 19 (3DS)
patients received methadone. The mean preswitch morphine doses were 900 mg/day in
SAG and 1330 mg/day in 3DS. No differences between groups were found in mean
average PI day 3 (mean difference 0.5 (CI -1.2-2.2); SAG 4.1 (CI 2.3-5.9) and 3DS
3.6 (CI 2.9-4.3) or in PI now. The SAG group had more dropouts and three SAEs
(two deaths and one severe sedation). No SAEs were observed in the 3DS group.
CONCLUSION: The SAG patients reported a trend of more pain, had significantly
more dropouts and three SAEs, which indicate that the SAG strategy should not
replace the 3DS when switching from high doses of morphine or oxycodone to
methadone.

A systematic review of the use of opioid medication for those with moderate to
severe cancer pain and renal impairment: a European Palliative Care Research
Collaborative opioid guidelines project.

Haematology Centre, Bristol BS2 8ED, UK. sjk21@doctors.net.uk

BACKGROUND: Opioid use in patients with renal impairment can lead to increased
adverse effects. Opioids differ in their effect in renal impairment in both
efficacy and tolerability. This systematic literature review forms the basis of
guidelines for opioid use in renal impairment and cancer pain as part of the
European Palliative Care Research Collaborative's opioid guidelines project.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify and assess the quality of 
evidence for the safe and effective use of opioids for the relief of cancer pain 
in patients with renal impairment and to produce guidelines.
SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials, MedLine, EMBASE and CINAHL were systematically
searched in addition to hand searching of relevant journals.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were included if they reported a clinical outcome
relevant to the use of selected opioids in cancer-related pain and renal
impairment. The selected opioids were morphine, diamorphine, codeine,
dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, buprenorphine,
tramadol, alfentanil, fentanyl, sufentanil, remifentanil, pethidine and
methadone. No direct comparator was required for inclusion. Studies assessing the
long-term efficacy of opioids during dialysis were excluded.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: This is a narrative systematic review and no
meta-analysis was performed. The Grading of RECOMMENDATIONS Assessment,
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of the
studies and to formulate guidelines.
MAIN RESULTS: Fifteen original articles were identified. Eight prospective and
seven retrospective clinical studies were identified but no randomized controlled
trials. No results were found for diamorphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine,
buprenorphine, tramadol, dextropropoxyphene, methadone or remifentanil.
CONCLUSIONS: All of the studies identified have a significant risk of bias
inherent in the study methodology and there is additional significant risk of
publication bias. Overall evidence is of very low quality. The direct clinical
evidence in cancer-related pain and renal impairment is insufficient to allow
formulation of guidelines but is suggestive of significant differences in risk
between opioids.
RECOMMENDATIONS: RECOMMENDATIONS regarding opioid use in renal impairment and
cancer pain are made on the basis of pharmacokinetic data, extrapolation from
non-cancer pain studies and from clinical experience. The risk of opioid use in
renal impairment is stratified according to the activity of opioid metabolites,
potential for accumulation and reports of successful or harmful use. Fentanyl,
alfentanil and methadone are identified, with caveats, as the least likely to
cause harm when used appropriately. Morphine may be associated with toxicity in
patients with renal impairment. Unwanted side effects with morphine may be
satisfactorily dealt with by either increasing the dosing interval or reducing
the 24 hour dose or by switching to an alternative opioid.

and Oncology Centre, Bristol BS2 8ED, UK. sjk21@doctors.net.uk

BACKGROUND: Oxycodone is often used as an opioid analgesic for moderate to severe
cancer-related pain, but its use varies across Europe. This systematic literature
review forms the basis of guidelines for oxycodone use within the European
Palliative Care Research Collaborative opioid guidelines project conducted on
behalf of the European Association for Palliative Care.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify and assess the quality of
evidence for the use of oxycodone for cancer pain in adults.
METHODS: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials, MedLine, EMBASE and CINAHL were systematically searched in 
addition to hand searching of relevant journals. Studies were included if they
reported a clinical outcome relevant to the use of oxycodone in adult patients
with moderate to severe cancer pain. Any form and route of oxycodone was included
except intrathecal. No direct comparator was required for inclusion and studies
were excluded if patients had previously switched from another strong opioid
because of intolerable adverse effects or poor efficacy. This is a narrative
systematic review, using the GRADE approach to assess the quality of studies and 
to formulate guidelines.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine original studies were identified including a meta-analysis
and 14 randomized controlled trials. The identified meta-analysis included three 
trials comparing oxycodone to morphine and one comparing oxycodone to
hydromorphone. Four other randomized trials compared oxycodone with other
opioids. The remaining randomized controlled trials compared different routes of 
administration or formulations of oxycodone. No additional studies that would
have been suitable for addition to the meta-analysis were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence from the included trials of a significant
difference in analgesia or adverse effects between oxycodone and morphine or
hydromorphone. The evidence was graded as high quality on the basis of a
well-conducted meta-analysis, with no limitations likely to affect the outcome,
in addition to consistency in the results of the other studies. The research was 
conducted using participants relevant to cancer and palliative care populations. 
Oxycodone can be recommended as an alternative to morphine or hydromorphone for
cancer-related pain.

BACKGROUND: There are no population-based data comparing analgesics after Mohs
micrographic surgery (MMS) and reconstruction. OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy 
in pain management of three analgesic combinations.
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, controlled study, patients undergoing MMS
and reconstruction for head and neck skin cancers received 1,000 mg of
acetaminophen (Ac), 1,000 mg Ac plus 400 mg ibuprofen (Ib), or 325 mg Ac plus 30 
mg codeine (Co) immediately after surgery and every 4 hours for up to four doses.
Patients rated their pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours
after surgery and recorded medication-related side effects.
RESULTS: The Ac+Ib group had the lowest pain scores (mean change from
baseline/immeditely prior to surgery) at each postoperative recorded time
interval and a significantly smaller change from baseline pain scores than the
Ac+Co group at 4 hours (p=.005) and the Ac group at 8 hours (p=.02). Ac+Ib was
also superior in pain control for patients with surgical areas smaller than 10
cm(2) . Complications in the Ib+Ac group were significantly lower than in the
Ac+Co group but not the Ac group.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of Ac+Ib is superior to Ac alone or Ac+Co in
controlling postoperative pain after MMS and cutaneous reconstruction.

Efficacy of oxycodone/paracetamol for patients with bone-cancer pain: a
multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.

WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Bone-cancer pain is a common and refractory cancer
pain. Opioids, on their own, do not control this type of pain well enough, and
co-analgesics are necessary.
METHODS: Patients with bone metastasis-related pain at Numeric Rating Scale ≥4
were enrolled to this randomized placebo-controlled trial. They had also received
morphine or transdermal fentanyl patches for at least 1 week. During the 3-day
efficacy phase, patients received placebo or 1-3 tablets of oxycodone/paracetamol
(5/325 mg), four times daily for 3 days. All patients kept a daily pain diary.
The primary endpoint was the Pain Intensity Difference (PID). Secondary endpoints
were cases of breakthrough pain and rescue morphine consumption. Additional
analyses included the Short Form-6 Dimensions (SF-6D) quality-of-life scale and a
general impression (GI) of patient satisfaction with treatment at the end of the 
phase.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of the 246 patients in the intent-to-treat set, 89·4%
completed the 3-day efficacy phase. PIDs were 0·9 and 0·3 in the
oxycodone/paracetamol and placebo groups respectively, on day 1 (P < 0·001), and 
1·5 and 0·3 respectively on day 3 (P < 0·001). Thirty-eight patients in the
treatment group, and 58 in the placebo group, suffered breakthrough pain on day 3
(P < 0·001). The SF-6D score decreased to 21·2 ± 2·5 in the oxycodone/paracetamol
group at the end of the phase (P = 0·001). In the oxycodone/paracetamol group,
67% rated GI as good, very good, or excellent.
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Patients with bone-cancer pain, already on opioids,
obtain clinically important, additional pain-control, with regular
oxycodone/paracetamol dosing.

Some sources suggest that significant misuse of opioid drugs exists among
patients with chronic pain. However, the risk factors and motivation behind their
abuse may differ from those of other opioid abusers. This study sought to examine
the abuse liability of oxycodone among patients with chronic, non-malignant pain 
who met the DSM-IV criteria for opioid abuse. Eighteen opioid-dependent patients 
with chronic pain lived on an in-patient unit of the New York State Psychiatric
Institute during the 7-week study. Participants were given oral oxycodone (0, 10,
20, 40, and 60 mg/70 kg) while maintained on various doses of sublingual
buprenorphine/naloxone (Bup/Nx; 2/0.5, 8/2, and 16/4 mg/day). Doses of both
medications were administered under double-blind conditions. Oxycodone produced
an overall positive, but less robust, subjective profile than previously reported
in recreational opioid users without pain. Furthermore, unlike our findings in
recreational opioid users and more similar to effects in non-drug-abusing
individuals, oxycodone failed to serve as a reinforcer. As for the maintenance
drug, Bup/Nx produced a dose-related reduction in some of the effects of acutely 
administered oxycodone. These data suggest that sublingual Bup/Nx has the
potential as an analgesic medication and further research should investigate its 
use in treating patients with chronic pain who abuse opioids.

OBJECTIVE: According to experimental findings, oxycodone (OX) could have some
advantages over morphine (MO) in clinical models of visceral pain. It was
hypothesized that OX could have some advantages over MO in terms of efficacy and 
dose escalation in pancreatic cancer pain.
METHODS: Sixty patients with pancreatic cancer with a pain intensity rating of
4/10 who required opioids were included in the study. Patients were randomized to
receive 30 mg/d of sustained release oral MO or sustained release oral OX (20
mg/d). Opioid doses were increased according to the clinical needs. Daily doses
of opioids, pain and symptom intensity were recorded at admission (T0) and at
weekly intervals for the subsequent 4 weeks (T1, T2, T3, and T4), with an
extension at 8 weeks (T8). Opioid escalation index (OEI) as percentage (OEI %)
and in mg (OEI mg) was calculated.
RESULTS: Nineteen and 20 patients in groups OX and MO, respectively, were
followed for the entire period of study (T4). No differences between groups were 
found in age (P=0.400), Karnofsky (P=0.667), or escalation indexes at T4 and T8
(OEImg, P=0.945 and OEI %, P=0.295). No statistical differences in pain and
symptoms intensity between the groups were observed.
CONCLUSION: OX and MO provided similar analgesia and adverse effects with similar
escalating doses in patients with pancreatic cancer pain, resembling observations
reported in the general cancer pain population. The experimental hypothesis that 
OX would be superior to MO in the clinical model of pancreatic cancer pain was
not confirmed.

The impact of tramadol and dihydrocodeine treatment on quality of life of
patients with cancer pain.

Leppert W(1), Majkowicz M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Palliative Medicine, Poznan University of Medical Sciences,
Poznan, Poland. wojciechleppert@wp.pl

BACKGROUND: Tramadol and dihydrocodeine (DHC) are analgesics of step 2 WHO
analgesic ladder (opioids for mild to moderate pain, weak opioids) frequently
used in the treatment of cancer pain of moderate intensity. The aim of the study 
was to assess the impact of tramadol and DHC treatment on quality of life (QL)
and performance status (PS) of patients with cancer pain.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Randomised, cross-over, clinical study of 40 opioid-naive
patients with nociceptive cancer pain who received tramadol or DHC controlled
release tablets for 7 days, and then drugs were switched and administered for
another 7 days. Pain was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS), QL by EORTC QLQ
C 30, and PS by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and Karnofsky.
RESULTS: From 40 patients recruited, 30 completed the study. DHC treatment
provided better analgesia (VAS). In QL functional scales, better emotional
functioning in tramadol group and better global QL and cognitive functioning in
DHC group were observed. In symptom scales, less fatigue, pain and sleep
disturbances, less nausea and vomiting and better appetite in DHC group were
noted. In tramadol group, less constipation and less financial problems were
observed. No differences in dyspnoea and diarrhoea were noted. ECOG and Karnofsky
PS were low and did not differ between tramadol and DHC groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Dihydrocodeine treatment was associated with better global QL,
cognitive functioning, analgesia and appetite, less fatigue, sleep disturbances, 
nausea and vomiting. Tramadol therapy was connected with better emotional
functioning, less constipation and financial problems. PS deteriorated in both
tramadol and DHC groups.

trials.

BACKGROUND: Two randomised 12-week, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter
studies comparing oxycodone PR/naloxone PR and oxycodone PR alone on symptoms of 
opioid-induced bowel dysfunction in patients with moderate/severe non-malignant
pain have been conducted.
METHODS: These studies were prospectively designed to be pooled and the primary
outcome measure of the pooled data analysis was to demonstrate non-inferiority in
12-week analgesic efficacy of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR versus oxycodone PR alone.
Patients with opioid-induced constipation were switched to oxycodone PR and then 
randomised to fixed doses of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR (n = 292) or oxycodone PR
(n = 295) for 12 weeks (20-80 mg/day).
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in analgesic efficacy were
observed for the two treatments (p = 0.3197; non-inferiority p < 0.0001; 95% CI
-0.07, 0.23) and there was no statistically significant difference in frequency
of analgesic rescue medication use. Improvements in Bowel Function Index score
were observed for oxycodone PR/naloxone PR by Week 1 and at every subsequent time
point (-15.1; p < 0.0001; 95% CI -17.3, -13.0). AE incidence was similar for both
groups (61.0% and 57.3% of patients with oxycodone PR/naloxone PR and oxycodone
PR alone, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pooled analysis confirm that oxycodone PR/naloxone
PR provides effective analgesia and suggest that oxycodone PR/naloxone PR
improves bowel function without compromising analgesic efficacy.

Evaluation of efficacy of the perioperative administration of Venlafaxine or
gabapentin on acute and chronic postmastectomy pain.

OBJECTIVES: Postmastectomy pain syndrome is a neuropathic pain syndrome that is
known to develop after breast surgery. Preemptive analgesia has been shown to be 
efficacious in reducing postoperative pain, and may be effective in reducing the 
incidence of certain types of neuropathic pain. We investigated the analgesic
efficacy of Venlafaxine and gabapentin on acute and chronic pain associated with 
cancer breast surgery.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out on 150 patients scheduled for
either partial or radical mastectomy with axillary dissection. They were
randomized in a double-blinded manner to receive, extended release Venlafaxine
37.5 mg/d, gabapentin 300 mg/d, or placebo for 10 days starting the night before 
operation. Pain scores were recorded at rest and movement (visual analog scale)
at 4, 12, and 24 hours on the first day postoperatively, daily from the second to
tenth day postoperatively and visual analog scale in addition to pain character 6
months later. Analgesic requirements were compared between the 3 groups.
RESULTS: Pain after movement was reduced by gabapentin from the second to tenth
postoperative day and venlafaxine group in the last 3 days but no difference was 
found between the groups regarding pain during rest. Gabapentin reduced morphine 
consumed in the first 24 hours postoperatively. The analgesic requirements from
the second to tenth days for codeine and paracetamol were reduced in venlafaxine 
and gabapentin groups compared to the control group. Six months later, the
incidence of chronic pain, its intensity, and need for analgesics were reduced in
venlafaxine compared to gabapentin and the placebo group. However, burning pain
was more frequent in the control groups than in the gabapentin.
CONCLUSION: Venlafaxine 37.5 mg/d extended release or gabapentin 300 mg/d have
equipotent effects (except on the first day in venlafaxine group) in reducing
analgesic requirements, although gabapentin is more effective in reducing pain
after movement. Venlafaxine significantly reduced the incidence of postmastectomy
pain syndromes (chronic pain) 6 months in women having breast cancer surgery.
Gabapentin had no effect on chronic pain except decreasing incidence of burning
pain.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess safety and efficacy of fixed
combination oxycodone prolonged release (PR)/naloxone PR in terms of both
analgesia and improving opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) and associated
symptoms, such as opioid-induced constipation (OIC), in adults with chronic
non-cancer pain.
STUDY DESIGN: These were open-label extension studies in which patients who had
previously completed a 12-week, double-blind study received oxycodone PR/naloxone
PR for up to 52 weeks. The analgesia study assessed pain using the modified Brief
Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF). The bowel function study assessed
improvements in constipation using the Bowel Function Index (BFI).
RESULTS: At open-label baseline in the analgesia study (n = 379), mean score [+/-
standard deviation (SD)] for the BPI-SF item 'average pain over the last 24 h'
was 3.9 +/- 1.52, and this remained low at 6 months (3.7 +/- 1.59) and 12 months 
(3.8 +/- 1.72). Mean scores for BPI-SF item 'sleep interference', and the BPI-SF 
'pain' and 'interference with activities' subscales also remained low throughout 
the 52-week study. In the bowel function study (n = 258), mean BFI score (+/- SD)
decreased from 35.6 +/- 27.74 at the start of the extension study to 20.6 +/-
24.01 after 12 months of treatment with oxycodone PR/naloxone PR. Pain scores
also remained low and stable during this study. Adverse events in both extension 
phases were consistent with those associated with opioid therapy; no additional
safety concerns were observed.
CONCLUSION: Results from these two open-label extension studies demonstrate the
long-term efficacy and tolerability of fixed combination oxycodone PR/naloxone PR
in the treatment of chronic pain. Patients experienced clinically relevant
improvements in OIBD while receiving effective analgesic therapy.

In most cancer patients, pain is successfully treated with pharmacological
measures such as opioid analgesics alone or opioid analgesics combined with
adjuvant analgesics (co-analgesics). Opioids for mild-to-moderate pain (formerly 
called weak opioids) are usually recommended in the treatment of cancer pain of
moderate intensity. There is a debate whether the second step of the WHO
analgesic ladder, which, in Poland, is composed of opioids such as tramadol,
codeine, dihydrocodeine (DHC), is still needed for cancer pain treatment. One of 
the most interesting and useful drugs in this group is tramadol. Its unique
mechanism of action, analgesic efficacy and profile of adverse effects are
responsible for its successful use in patients with different types of acute and 
chronic pain, including neuropathic pain. The aim of this article is to summarize
the data regarding pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, possible drug
interactions, adverse effects, dosing guidelines, equipotency with other opioid
analgesics and clinical studies comparing efficacy, adverse reactions and safety 
of tramadol to other opioids in cancer pain treatment.

District, Beijing 100142, PR China.

OBJECTIVES: Intracostal suture or intercostal muscle flap can reduce
post-thoracotomy pain through the preservation of intercostal nerves below or
above the incision. This study aims to test whether combining intracostal suture 
with intercostal muscle flap might achieve better pain relief than intracostal
suture alone.
METHODS: This study included 144 consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary
resection. Eighty patients entered the trial but eight were excluded. Seventy-two
patients were randomly assigned to a muscle flap group, in which the fifth
intercostal muscle and neurovascular bundle were raised and intracostal suture on
the sixth rib was applied. For the control group, only intracostal suturing on
the sixth rib was done. All patients had a functional epidural placed, which were
removed 24h after surgery. Differences on average numeric rating scale (aNRS)
scores were assessed in an early post-operative period from day 1 to day 7 and a 
later period from week 2 to week 12, when patients were resting or coughing. The 
doses of oxycodone demand and hyperalgesia-related intercostal dermatomes (HIDs) 
were recorded for analysis.
RESULTS: No differences were noted between the two groups in terms of length and 
width of the incision, or duration of rib retraction. Neither in different time
periods (early or late) nor the activity status (while resting or coughing)
yielded a statistical difference on aNRS scores between the muscle flap group and
the control group (muscle flap group vs control group: mean (95% confidence
intervals) from d ay 1 to day 7, 4.42 (1.56-7.28) vs 4.79 (2.03-7.55) on coughing
(p=0.282); median (inter-quartile range, IQR) from day 1 to day 7, 1.71 (0.86-3) 
vs 2.50 (1.16-3.12) while resting (p=0.279); median (IQR) from week 2 to week 12,
0.43 (0-0.86) vs 0.48 (0.06-1.20) on coughing (p=0.595); median (IQR) from week 2
to week 12, 0 (0-0.14) vs 0.05 (0-0.14) while resting (p=0.856)). No differences 
were found in total oxycodone consumption from day 1 to day 7 between the two
groups (Z=-1.821, p=0.069). The rate of HIDs in each intercostal space and median
number of HIDs were similar between the two groups on day 1 (p>0.05) and day 7
(p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of intracostal suture with intercostal muscle flap
may not necessarily achieve better post-thoracotomy pain control than using
intracostal suture alone.

BACKGROUND: Brief treatments for chronic non-malignant pain patients with
problematic opioid use are warranted. The aims of the present study were to
investigate (1) whether it is possible to withdraw codeine use in such patients
with a brief cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), (2) whether this could be done 
without pain escalation and reduction in quality of life and (3) to explore the
effects of codeine reduction on neurocognitive functioning.
METHODS: Eleven patients using codeine daily corresponding to 40-100 mg morphine 
were included. Two specifically trained physicians treated the patients with six 
CBT sessions, tapering codeine gradually within 8 weeks. Codeine use, pain
intensity, quality of life and neuropsychological functioning were assessed at
pre-treatment to the 3-month follow-up.
RESULTS: Codeine use was significantly reduced from mean 237 mg [standard
deviation (SD) 65] pre-treatment to 45 mg (SD 66) post-treatment and to 48 mg (SD
65) at follow-up without significant pain escalation or reductions in quality of 
life. Moreover, neuropsychological functioning improved significantly on some
tests, while others remained unchanged.
CONCLUSION: The promising findings of codeine reduction in this weaning therapy
programme for pain patients with problematic opioid use should be further
evaluated in a larger randomized control trial comparing this brief CBT with both
another brief treatment and attention placebo condition.

Validation of the Bowel Function Index to detect clinically meaningful changes in
opioid-induced constipation.

Rentz AM(1), Yu R, Müller-Lissner S, Leyendecker P.

Author information: 
(1)Center for Health Outcomes Research, United Biosource Corporation, Bethesda,
MD, USA.

OBJECTIVE: The Bowel Function Index (BFI) is a clinician-administered,
patient-reported, 3-item questionnaire to evaluate opioid-induced constipation in
cancer and non-cancer chronic pain patients. The objective of the present
analysis was to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of the BFI using data
from clinical studies of oral prolonged release (PR) oxycodone/naloxone.
METHODS: OXN2401 was a multicenter, controlled, randomized, double-blind,
parallel-group study including oral PR oxycodone combined with oral PR naloxone
as well as oral PR oxycodone combined with corresponding naloxone placebo.
OXN3401 and OXN3001 were 12-week multicenter, controlled, randomized,
double-blind, parallel-group studies of a fixed combination of oral PR
oxycodone/naloxone versus PR oxycodone. In addition, a placebo group was included
in study OXN3401. BFI psychometric characteristics (reliability, reproducibility,
convergent/known groups validity, and responsiveness) were evaluated.
RESULTS: Demographic data (n=985) were comparable and analyses indicated a high
degree of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >0.7). Change of less than 5
points in BFI was indicative of high reproducibility. Correlations between BFI
item and total scores to stool frequency were statistically significant and in
the low-to-moderate range (OXN2401 -0.23 to -0.29, p < 0.001; OXN3401 range -0.26
to -0.40, p < 0.001; OXN3001 -0.14 to -0.15, p < 0.05). Data indicate that a BFI 
score change of ≥12 points represents a clinically meaningful change in
constipation.
LIMITATIONS: This publication for validation of BFI only includes data from three
clinical trials. However, another publication of an additional specifically
designed cross-sectional validation study is in preparation.
CONCLUSION: The BFI is a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of
opioid-induced constipation in chronic pain patients. Psychometric analyses from 
clinical trials support the BFI's psychometric properties.

Essen, DE-45239 Essen, Germany. sandra.kampe@ruhrlandklinik.uk-essen.de

AIMS: To assess clinical equivalence of 20 mg controlled-release oxycodone
(Oxygesic; Mundipharma, Limburg, Germany) and 200 mg controlled-release tramadol 
(Tramal long; Grunenthal, Aachen, Germany) on a 12-hour dosing schedule in a
randomized, double-blinded study of 54 ASA I-III physical status (American
Society of Anesthesiologists classification of physical status) patients
undergoing surgery for breast cancer.
METHODS: General anesthesia using remifentanil and propofol was performed for
surgery. Patients were randomly allocated to 2 groups, receiving either 20 mg
controlled-release oxycodone (Oxy group) or 200 mg controlled-release tramadol
(Trama group) with the premedication (7.5 mg midazolam) and again 12 hours later.
All patients had access to rescue medication (i.v. paracetamol). The primary
variables for clinical equivalence were the differences between the mean values
for pain scores at rest and pain scores on coughing over 24 hours after
operation. The equivalence margin was determined as +/-10 on the visual analogue 
scale.
RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were enrolled. Regarding pain scores at rest, the
90% CI of the mean differences between the treatment groups over 24 hours after
operation was found to be within the predefined equivalence margin [-4.5 to
+1.7], and the CI values for pain scores on coughing [-6.2 to +1.7] were similar.
Cumulative paracetamol given over the 24-hour observation period did not differ
significantly between the Oxy group (1.32 +/-1.9 g) and the Trama group (1.61 +/-
1.1 g; p = 0.32). There were no significant differences between the treatment
groups regarding adverse events such as nausea (p = 0.13), vomiting (p = 0.24)
and itching (p = 0.77). Also, no differences were found concerning patient
satisfaction scores (p = 0.8) or patients' general perception of postoperative
pain management (p = 0.71).
CONCLUSION: 20 mg controlled-release oxycodone is clinically equivalent to 200 mg
controlled-release tramadol for postoperative analgesia after surgery for breast 
cancer.

Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction in cancer-related pain: causes, consequences,
and a novel approach for its management.

Opioids are the mainstay of management for patients with cancer-related pain.
Although the analgesic efficacy of opioid therapy is well documented, the recent 
European Pain in Cancer survey demonstrated that the management of
moderate-to-severe pain in patients with cancer is far from optimal. Bowel
dysfunction, and importantly constipation, is a common side effect and has a
significant impact on the patient's morbidity and quality of life.
Nonpharmacological strategies and laxatives are often not effective in the
management of opioid-induced constipation (OIC), making it necessary to search
for new strategies for the treatment of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. One
promising strategy is the prevention of OIC with peripherally acting opioid
antagonists that specifically target the underlying cause of this condition,
without affecting centrally mediated analgesia. In recent studies, the novel
combination of prolonged-release oral oxycodone and prolonged-release oral
naloxone provided effective analgesia with improved bowel function in patients
suffering from severe cancer-related and noncancer-related pain. The combination 
has the potential to improve the quality of pain management significantly in
these patients.

BACKGROUND: This randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group
multicentre study assessed the impact of a total daily dose of 60-80 mg oral
oxycodone prolonged-release (PR)/naloxone PR (OXN PR) as fixed-ratio combination 
for patients with opioid-induced constipation (OIC) having moderate-to-severe,
non-malignant pain.
METHODS: During pre-randomisation patients receiving opioids for
moderate-to-severe non-malignant pain were converted to oxycodone PR (OXY PR) and
titrated to an effective analgesic dose. During randomisation 265 patients on a
stable OXY PR dose (60-80 mg/day) and with OIC were included in the full analysis
population to receive OXN PR or OXY PR alone. Primary outcome was improvement in 
symptoms of constipation as measured by the Bowel Function Index (BFI).
Secondary/exploratory outcomes examined analgesic efficacy and other bowel
function parameters.
RESULTS: After 4 weeks of treatment, patients receiving OXN PR showed a
significant improvement in bowel function compared with those in the OXY PR group
(-14.9; 95% CI: -17.9, -11.9; p<0.0001) as measured by BFI which was seen after
only 1 week of treatment continuing to the end of the study. After 4 weeks of
treatment, patients receiving OXN PR had a median number of 3.0 complete
spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM) per week compared with only 1.0 for OXY PR
alone. Laxative intake was lower in the OXN PR than the OXY PR group.
Furthermore, improvements in bowel function were achieved without loss of
analgesic efficacy; pain intensity scores were comparable between the groups and 
consistent for duration of the study. Most frequently reported adverse events
were consistent with those reported for opioid analgesics; no new or unexpected
adverse reactions attributable to OXN PR used in higher doses were observed.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that the fixed-ratio combination of OXN PR is
superior to OXY PR alone in terms of bowel function, while providing effective
equivalent analgesia.

Opioid analgesics are the cornerstone of pain management for moderate-to-severe
cancer pain and, increasingly, chronic noncancer pain. Despite proven analgesic
efficacy, the use of opioids is commonly associated with frequently dose-limiting
constipation that seriously impacts on patients' quality of life. Agents
currently used to manage opioid-induced constipation (OIC), such as laxatives, do
not address the underlying opioid receptor-mediated cause of constipation and are
often ineffective. A significant need therefore exists for more effective
treatment options. A novel approach for selectively and locally antagonizing the 
gastrointestinal effects of opioids involves the coadministration of a mu-opioid 
receptor antagonist with negligible systemic availability, such as oral naloxone.
Combination therapy with prolonged-release (PR) oxycodone plus PR naloxone has
been shown to provide effective analgesia while preventing or reducing
constipation. The current article highlights this novel strategy in its potential
to significantly improve the quality of life of patients suffering from chronic
pain, affording patients the benefit of full analgesia, without the burden of
OIC.

Clinical cough VI: the need for new therapies for cough: disease-specific and
symptom-related antitussives.

Chung KF(1).

Author information: 
(1)National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK.
f.chung@imperial.ac.uk

Cough is a common symptom that can be self-limiting or persistent. Ideally,
treatment of the underlying cause(s) of cough with specific treatments should
eliminate cough. This approach may not be successful if no cause can be
established or if the treatment of the cause fails. Suppression of cough may be
disease-specific or symptom-related. There has been a long tradition in acute
cough usually due to upper respiratory tract infections to use symptom-related
antitussives. In chronic cough, suppression of cough may be achieved by
disease-specific therapies, but in many patients it may be necessary to use
symptomatic antitussives. The efficacy of some over-the-counter symptomatic
antitussives is often no better than that of a placebo. Currently available cough
suppressants include the centrally acting opioids such as morphine, codeine,
pholcodeine, and dextromethorphan. Early studies reported success in reducing
cough in patients with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD); however, a carefully conducted blinded controlled study showed no
effect of codeine on cough of COPD. Success with these cough suppressants may be 
achieved at high doses that are associated with side effects. A slow-release
preparation of morphine has been shown to have some degree of efficacy, but this 
should be reserved for the most severe chronic cough patient, and for patients
with terminal cancer who may also benefit from its analgesic effects. There are
case reports of the success of centrally acting drugs such as amitriptyline,
paroxetine, gabapentin, and carbamezepine in chronic cough. New agents derived
from basic research such as new opioids such as nociceptin or antagonists of
transient receptor potential vanniloid-1 may turn out to have antitussive
effects. Efficacy of symptomatic cough suppressants must be tested in
double-blind randomized trials using validated measures of cough in patients with
chronic cough not responding to specific treatments. Patients with chronic cough 
need effective antitussives that could be used either on demand or on a long-term
basis.

Oxycodone and the challenge of neuropathic cancer pain: a review.

Núñez Olarte JM(1).

Author information: 
(1)Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, España.
jmnunez.hgugm@salud.madrid.org

In order to evaluate the potential role of oxycodone in cancer pain management,
neuropathic cancer pain was selected as a model for difficult pain syndromes. A
nonsystematic, yet exhaustive, review of the literature provided the relevant
evidence for the discussion. Ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 5
open-label studies on oxycodone and cancer pain, 3 RCTs and 1 open-label study on
oxycodone and neuropathic pain, and 2 RCTs on oxycodone and visceral pain were
identified and reviewed. Additionally, 5 basic research studies that contributed 
to our knowledge of the specific mechanisms of action of oxycodone were also
reviewed. Finally, recent evidence-based reviews of RCTs on neuropathic pain were
selected (6 reviews), and specific RCTs on neuropathic cancer pain were also
identified (2 trials). The review of the literature shows that the management of 
neuropathic cancer pain has changed dramatically in the last few years thanks to 
new approaches and novel drugs. The vast majority of these new drugs have been
proven to be useful in 'benign' neuropathic pain syndromes. The intrinsic
difficulties in performing RCTs in cancer pain have traditionally justified the
acceptance of drugs already known to be effective in benign neuropathic pain, in 
spite of insufficient evidence in malignant neuropathic pain. Therefore, a case
is made for the development of specific guidelines for the management of both
simple and complex cases of neuropathic cancer pain. An example of one of such
clinical guidelines is provided, in which the role of oxycodone is particularly
relevant given the existing evidence.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of OxyContin
tablets(controlled-release oxycodone hydrochloride: 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg) in
relieving moderate to severe postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) pain.
METHOD: A multicenter, open-label, prospective, self-controlled clinical
observation.
RESULTS: Pain was relieved in 17.3% of patients within 30 min and in 94.1%
patients within 1 h after drug administration. OxyContin tablets showed good
clinical efficacy in relieving both moderate and severe PHN pain. Response rate
reached 98.4% at the end of the 8th week of treatment. After the 1st week of
treatment, stable pain relief was achieved, and pain scores on a Visual Analogue 
Scale decreased dramatically in most patients. During treatment with
controlled-release OxyContin tablets, the use of concomitant medications was
significantly decreased. Some patients developed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in
the 1st week, which decreased significantly during the following weeks of
treatment. Nausea (18.1%) was the most commonly reported ADR, followed by
constipation (10.1%) and dizziness (10.1%). A number of ADRs disappeared during
treatment.
CONCLUSION: Controlled-release OxyContin tablets demonstrated fast onset of PHN
pain control, superior efficacy in relieving both moderate and severe PHN pain,
and a good safety profile.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluatethe efficacy and safety of OxyContin tablets
(controlled-release oxycodone hydrochloride: 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg) in relieving
moderate to severe cancer pain.
METHOD: A multicenter, open-label, prospective, self-controlled clinical trial
was used.
RESULTS: Pain was relieved in 89.1% of patients within 1 h after drug
administration. OxyContin tablets showed good clinical efficacy in relieving both
moderate and severe cancer pain. Compared with baseline average pain scores of
6.9 +/- 1.4, subjects had lower average pain scores after administration of
OxyContin tablets: 2.7 +/- 1.8 after 1 week and 2.1 +/- 1.5 after 2 weeks.
Response rate reached 75.0% at the end of the 1st week and was maintained at
approximately 90% from the 3rd to the 8th week. The most common adverse drug
reactions (ADRs) caused by OxyContintablets were, in descending order of
incidence rate: constipation (25.5%), nausea (13.3%), vomiting (6.2%), lethargy
(3.7%), and dysuria (2.1%). All these ADRs could be decreased by preventive
medications.
CONCLUSION: OxyContin tablets demonstrated fast onset of cancer pain control,
superior efficacy in relieving both moderate and severe cancer pain and a good
safety profile.

BACKGROUND: Opioid-induced constipation can have a major negative impact on
patients' quality of life. This randomised, double-blinded study evaluated the
analgesic efficacy of prolonged-release (PR) oral oxycodone when co-administered 
with PR oral naloxone, and its impact on opioid-induced constipation in patients 
with severe chronic pain. Another objective was to identify the optimal dose
ratio of oxycodone and naloxone.
METHODS: A total of 202 patients with chronic pain (mainly non-cancer related,
2.5% of patients had cancer-related pain) under stable oral oxycodone therapy
(40, 60 or 80 mg/day) were randomised to receive 10, 20, 40 mg/day naloxone or
placebo. After a 4-week maintenance phase, patients received oxycodone only for 2
weeks. Pain intensity was evaluated using a numerical analogue scale and bowel
function was assessed using the bowel function index.
RESULTS: No loss of analgesic efficacy with naloxone was observed. Mean pain
intensity scores on randomisation were comparable for placebo, 10mg, 20mg and 40 
mg naloxone dose, and remained unchanged during treatment. Bowel function
improved with increasing naloxone dose. Naloxone 20mg and 40 mg significantly
improved bowel function at the end of the maintenance phase compared with placebo
(p<0.05). Overall, the combination was well tolerated, with no unexpected adverse
events. There was a trend towards an increased incidence of diarrhoea with higher
doses of naloxone. The 2:1 oxycodone/naloxone ratio was identified as the most
suitable for further development.
CONCLUSION: Co-administration of PR oral naloxone and PR oral oxycodone is
associated with a significant improvement in bowel function compared with PR oral
oxycodone alone, with no reduction in the analgesic efficacy of oxycodone.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Opioid-induced constipation can have a major negative 
impact on patients' quality of life. This randomised clinical trial evaluated
patient assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of oral prolonged-release
(PR) oxycodone when co-administered with oral naloxone PR.
METHODS: Two hundred and two patients with chronic cancer- or non-cancer-related 
pain undergoing stable oxycodone PR therapy (40, 60 or 80 mg/day) were randomised
to one of four intervention groups: 10, 20 or 40 mg/day naloxone PR or placebo.
Following a 4-week maintenance phase, patients were followed-up for 2 weeks in
which time they received oxycodone PR only. At the end of the maintenance phase, 
patients and investigators were asked to assess treatment efficacy and
tolerability, as well as preference for the titration or maintenance phase.
RESULTS: Patient and investigator global assessment of efficacy and tolerability 
improved with increasing naloxone dose. Efficacy was ranked as 'good' or 'very
good' by 50.0%, 67.4% and 72.5% of patients in the 10, 20 and 40 mg naloxone PR
dose groups, respectively, compared with 43.5% of patients in the placebo group. 
Patient assessment of tolerability was similar between treatment groups and
placebo, being ranked as 'good' or 'very good' by 83.3%, 79.1% and 82.5% of
patients in the 10, 20 and 40 mg/day naloxone PR dose groups, respectively,
compared with 71.7% of patients in the placebo group. The maintenance treatment
phase was preferred by patients in the naloxone groups. A 2 : 1 dose ratio of
oxycodone to naloxone was also assessed. Efficacy was ranked as 'good' or 'very
good' by 70.4% of patients treated with the 2 : 1 dose ratio compared with 43.5% 
of patients receiving placebo. Tolerability of the 2 : 1 dose ratio was ranked as
being 'good' or 'very good' by 81.5% of patients compared with 71.1% for the
placebo group and patients preferred the maintenance phase.
CONCLUSIONS: The co-administration of oral naloxone PR with oxycodone PR improves
patient assessment of analgesic opioid therapy for severe chronic pain, in terms 
of both efficacy and tolerability.

Opioids and the management of chronic severe pain in the elderly: consensus
statement of an International Expert Panel with focus on the six clinically most 
often used World Health Organization Step III opioids (buprenorphine, fentanyl,
hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone).

SUMMARY OF CONSENSUS: 1. The use of opioids in cancer pain: The criteria for
selecting analgesics for pain treatment in the elderly include, but are not
limited to, overall efficacy, overall side-effect profile, onset of action, drug 
interactions, abuse potential, and practical issues, such as cost and
availability of the drug, as well as the severity and type of pain (nociceptive, 
acute/chronic, etc.). At any given time, the order of choice in the
decision-making process can change. This consensus is based on evidence-based
literature (extended data are not included and chronic, extended-release opioids 
are not covered). There are various driving factors relating to prescribing
medication, including availability of the compound and cost, which may, at times,
be the main driving factor. The transdermal formulation of buprenorphine is
available in most European countries, particularly those with high opioid usage, 
with the exception of France; however, the availability of the sublingual
formulation of buprenorphine in Europe is limited, as it is marketed in only a
few countries, including Germany and Belgium. The opioid patch is experimental at
present in U.S.A. and the sublingual formulation has dispensing restrictions,
therefore, its use is limited. It is evident that the population pyramid is
upturned. Globally, there is going to be an older population that needs to be
cared for in the future. This older population has expectations in life, in that 
a retiree is no longer an individual who decreases their lifestyle activities.
The "baby-boomers" in their 60s and 70s are "baby zoomers"; they want to have a
functional active lifestyle. They are willing to make trade-offs regarding
treatment choices and understand that they may experience pain, providing that
can have increased quality of life and functionality. Therefore,
comorbidities--including cancer and noncancer pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid
arthritis, and postherpetic neuralgia--and patient functional status need to be
taken carefully into account when addressing pain in the elderly. World Health
Organization step III opioids are the mainstay of pain treatment for cancer
patients and morphine has been the most commonly used for decades. In general,
high level evidence data (Ib or IIb) exist, although many studies have included
only few patients. Based on these studies, all opioids are considered effective
in cancer pain management (although parts of cancer pain are not or only
partially opioid sensitive), but no well-designed specific studies in the elderly
cancer patient are available. Of the 2 opioids that are available in transdermal 
formulation--fentanyl and buprenorphine--fentanyl is the most investigated, but
based on the published data both seem to be effective, with low toxicity and good
tolerability profiles, especially at low doses. 2. The use of opioids in
noncancer-related pain: Evidence is growing that opioids are efficacious in
noncancer pain (treatment data mostly level Ib or IIb), but need individual dose 
titration and consideration of the respective tolerability profiles. Again no
specific studies in the elderly have been performed, but it can be concluded that
opioids have shown efficacy in noncancer pain, which is often due to diseases
typical for an elderly population. When it is not clear which drugs and which
regimes are superior in terms of maintaining analgesic efficacy, the appropriate 
drug should be chosen based on safety and tolerability considerations.
Evidence-based medicine, which has been incorporated into best clinical practice 
guidelines, should serve as a foundation for the decision-making processes in
patient care; however, in practice, the art of medicine is realized when we
individualize care to the patient. This strikes a balance between the
evidence-based medicine and anecdotal experience. Factual recommendations and
expert opinion both have a value when applying guidelines in clinical practice.
3. The use of opioids in neuropathic pain: The role of opioids in neuropathic
pain has been under debate in the past but is nowadays more and more accepted;
however, higher opioid doses are often needed for neuropathic pain than for
nociceptive pain. Most of the treatment data are level II or III, and suggest
that incorporation of opioids earlier on might be beneficial. Buprenorphine shows
a distinct benefit in improving neuropathic pain symptoms, which is considered a 
result of its specific pharmacological profile. 4. The use of opioids in elderly 
patients with impaired hepatic and renal function: Functional impairment of
excretory organs is common in the elderly, especially with respect to renal
function. For all opioids except buprenorphine, half-life of the active drug and 
metabolites is increased in the elderly and in patients with renal dysfunction.
It is, therefore, recommended that--except for buprenorphine--doses be reduced, a
longer time interval be used between doses, and creatinine clearance be
monitored. Thus, buprenorphine appears to be the top-line choice for opioid
treatment in the elderly. 5. Opioids and respiratory depression: Respiratory
depression is a significant threat for opioid-treated patients with underlying
pulmonary condition or receiving concomitant central nervous system (CNS) drugs
associated with hypoventilation. Not all opioids show equal effects on
respiratory depression: buprenorphine is the only opioid demonstrating a ceiling 
for respiratory depression when used without other CNS depressants. The different
features of opioids regarding respiratory effects should be considered when
treating patients at risk for respiratory problems, therefore careful dosing must
be maintained. 6. Opioids and immunosuppression: Age is related to a gradual
decline in the immune system: immunosenescence, which is associated with
increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, 
and cancer, and decreased efficacy of immunotherapy, such as vaccination. The
clinical relevance of the immunosuppressant effects of opioids in the elderly is 
not fully understood, and pain itself may also cause immunosuppression. Providing
adequate analgesia can be achieved without significant adverse events, opioids
with minimal immunosuppressive characteristics should be used in the elderly. The
immunosuppressive effects of most opioids are poorly described and this is one of
the problems in assessing true effect of the opioid spectrum, but there is some
indication that higher doses of opioids correlate with increased
immunosuppressant effects. Taking into consideration all the very limited
available evidence from preclinical and clinical work, buprenorphine can be
recommended, while morphine and fentanyl cannot. 7. Safety and tolerability
profile of opioids: The adverse event profile varies greatly between opioids. As 
the consequences of adverse events in the elderly can be serious, agents should
be used that have a good tolerability profile (especially regarding CNS and
gastrointestinal effects) and that are as safe as possible in overdose especially
regarding effects on respiration. Slow dose titration helps to reduce the
incidence of typical initial adverse events such as nausea and vomiting.
Sustained release preparations, including transdermal formulations, increase
patient compliance.

[Differential therapeutic aspects of analgesia with oral sustained-release strong
opioids: application intervals, metabolism and immunosuppression].

[Article in German]

The oral "around-the clock" administration of sustained-release strong opioids
has been recommended for the long-term treatment of patients suffering from
chronic severe pain. At present a plethora of products are available in Germany. 
Modern galenics even allow for only once-daily oral application without
clinically relevant negative chronobiological interference. This application
scheme has been shown to improve compliance and sleep quality, factors that
influence treatment outcome. Randomized controlled studies revealed no relevant
differences between the different strong opioids with respect to efficacy and
tolerability. However, hydromorphone and oxycodone appear to be advantageous over
morphine due to a lack of immunosuppression. Hydromorphone has the additional
benefit of a lower risk of intoxication by accumulation of active metabolites in 
patients with decreased renal function. As a result, although morphine has been
regarded as the standard for the treatment of chronic severe pain, hydromorphone 
and oxycodone may be better and safer alternatives for certain patient groups
(e.g. older age, multimorbidity, cancer).

OBJECTIVE: To search for a safe and effective method for alleviating cancer pain.
METHODS: Sixty-six cases of late cancer with pain were first divided into 3
different degrees of pain, mild, moderate and severe, and then the patients with 
pain of each same degree were randomly divided into an acupuncture group treated 
by acupuncture at 3-5 of the most severe tender points, and a medication group
treated with oral administration according to the WHO Three Step Administration
Principle, i.e. the patients with mild pain took aspirin, moderate pain took
codeine and severe pain took morphine.
RESULTS: Both two methods could effectively control cancer pain. The total
effective rate of 94.1% in the acupuncture group was significantly better than
87.5% in the medication group (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The analgesic effect of acupuncture treatment is better than that of 
the Three Step Administration, with no adverse effect and addiction of
analgesics.

ABSTRACT Although the preferred route of opioid administration is oral, patients 
with cancer often require an alternative route. Options include continuous
subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) or regularly scheduled intermittent subcutaneous
injections (ISCI). CSCI maintains steady drug levels, theoretically avoiding the 
"bolus effect" of nausea and sedation immediately post-dose, and breakthrough
pain prior to the next dose. However, portable infusion pumps can be costly to
use. The Edmonton Injector is an inexpensive portable device for ISCI. CSCI and
ISCI have not been directly compared. The objective of this trial was to compare 
CSCI and ISCI of opioid for treatment of cancer pain. Patients were recruited
from two tertiary palliative care units. Eligibility criteria included stable
cancer pain requiring opioid therapy, need for parenteral route, and normal
cognition. Patients were randomly assigned to receive opioid by CSCI by portable 
pump or ISCI by Edmonton Injector for 48 hours, followed by crossover to the
alternative modality for 48 hours. During each phase, placebo was administered by
the alternative modality. The study was closed after 12 patients were entered,
due to slow accrual. Eleven patients completed the study. There were no
differences between CSCI and ISCI in mean visual analogue score (VAS) for pain,
nausea or drowsiness; categorical rating score of pain; number of breakthrough
opioid doses per day; global rating of treatment effectiveness; or adverse
effects. In all cases, patients and investigators expressed no preference for one
modality over another. Further research is required to confirm that opioid
administration by CSCI and ISCI provide similar analgesic and adverse effects.

OBJECTIVE: We prospectively investigated the efficacy of opioid rotation from
oral morphine to oral oxycodone in cancer patients who had difficulty in
continuing oral morphine treatment because of inadequate analgesia and/or
intolerable side effects.
METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled and 25 were evaluated. The rate of
patients who achieved adequate pain control, which provided an indication of
treatment success, was evaluated as primary endpoint. The acceptability and
pharmacokinetics of oxycodone were evaluated in addition to the assessment of
analgesic efficacy and safety during the study period.
RESULTS: In spite of intense pain, the morphine daily dose could not be increased
in most patients before the study because of intolerable side effects. However,
switching to oral oxycodone allowed approximately 1.7-fold increase as morphine
equivalent dose. Consequently, 84.0% (21/25) of patients achieved adequate pain
control. By the end of the study, all patients except one had tolerated the
morphine-induced intolerable side effects (i.e. nausea, vomiting, constipation,
drowsiness). Common side effects (>10%) that occurred during the study were
typically known for strong opioid analgesics, and most were mild to moderate in
severity. A significant negative correlation between creatinine clearance (CCr)
value and the trough concentrations of the morphine metabolites was observed. On 
the other hand, no significant correlation was found between CCr value and the
pharmacokinetic parameters of oxycodone or its metabolites.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients who had difficulty in continuing oral morphine
treatment, regardless of renal function, opioid rotation to oral oxycodone may be
an effective approach to alleviate intolerable side effects and pain.

    Clin J Pain. 2008 Sep;24(7):649.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy and
tolerability of opioids hydrocodone and tramadol in the relief of cancer pain.
METHODS: One hundred and eighteen patients with chronic cancer pain participated 
in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Sixty-two patients received
hydrocodone and 56 patients received tramadol.
RESULTS: Hydrocodone/acetaminophen was effective in relieving pain in 56.5% of
the patients at the starting dose of 25 mg/2500 mg/d. An additional 14.5% of the 
patients responded to a double dose, and the remaining 29% of patients did not
experience any pain relief from hydrocodone administration. One dose of tramadol 
at 200 mg/d produced pain relief in 62% of the patients and alleviated pain in
another 11% of patients at a dose of 400 mg/d, and remaining 27% of patients did 
not experience pain relief from tramadol. No significant statistical difference
in the analgesic efficacy of tramadol clorhydrate and hydrocodone/acetaminophen
was found. The groups differed significantly in the incidence of side effects
like nausea (P=0.03; relative risk (RR), 1.69; confidence interval (IC) 95%,
1.03-2.77), vomiting (P=0.02; RR, 2.21; IC 95%, 1.14-4.32), dizziness (P=0.03;
RR, 2.12; IC 95%, 1.17-3.86), loss of appetite (P=0.02; RR, 3.27; IC 95%,
1.12-9.55) and weakness (P=0.019; RR, 7.75; IC 95%, 0.98-61.05).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no superior analgesic efficacy with the administration of 
hydrocodone/acetaminophen when compared to patients receiving tramadol in the
relief of cancer pain. Tramadol produced more mild side effects than hydrocodone.

Author information:

China.

OBJECTIVE: Most treatments of acute pain associated with non-malignant chronic
pains are not satisfactory. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and
side effects of oxycondone controlled release (Oxy-CR) in managing chronic neck
pain with acute pain episodes.
DESIGN: Randomised, double-blind, stand controlled study. A total of 116 patients
were evenly divided into an oxycodone group (Oxy-CR, 5-10 mg and q12 h/day) and a
placebo group (placebo, q12 h/day). Patients were assessed for the frequency of
pain flares, visual analgesia score (VAS), quality of life (QOL), quality of
sleep (QOS) and adverse effects before the treatment and on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 
and 28 after the treatment. Withdrawal symptoms were monitored during the study, 
also on the completion of the entire study. The SF-36 was administered at the
beginning and the end of the study for each patient.
RESULTS: Compared with the baselines of Oxy-CR and the placebo groups, the
frequency of pain episodes and VAS were decreased significantly starting on day 3
of administration of Oxy-CR (p<0.05). Improvements in QOL and QOS were
significant on day 3 after treatment with Oxy-CR (p<0.05). The patients who were 
treated with Oxy-CR reported significantly higher side effects than the patients 
in the placebo group (p<0.05). However, these side effects started to diminish
after day 7 of the treatment. Withdrawal symptoms did not emerge in this study.
Most domains of SF-36 were improved in the treated patients at the end of study
(p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Oxycondone controlled release could be an important optional drug for
the management of refractory and frequent acute episodes of chronic neck pain in 
patients who failed to respond to non-opioid conservative treatment.

BACKGROUND: Analgesics are an essential component of the treatment of
cancer-associated pain. Pharmacologic treatment is usually begun with nonopioid
analgesics, most frequently acetaminophen. If pain relief is not achieved, the
so-called "weak" opioids, such as codeine and hydrocodone, may be used in
combination with acetaminophen. Adverse effects (AEs) of the opioids include
constipation, somnolence, nausea, and vomiting. Based on the results of a
literature search, data comparing the effects of the opioids are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy and
tolerability of codeine phosphate versus hydrocodone bitartrate in combination
with acetaminophen in the relief of cancer-related pain.
METHODS: This 23-day, prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study
was conducted at 3 Colombian centers: University Libre, Social Security
Institute, and General Hospital of Medellín, Cali, Colombia. Outpatients with
cancer were eligible for the study if they were aged >-18 years and had chronic
(duration, >/= 3 months) moderate to severe cancer-related pain (score on 10-cm
visual analog scale [VAS], > 3 cm [moderate]; score on a 4-point verbal
pain-intensity scale, > 1 [moderate]). Eligible patients were randomly assigned
to receive 1 tablet of codeine/acetaminophen (C/A) 30/500 mg or
hydrocodone/acetaminophen (H/A) 5/500 mg PO q4h (total daily doses, 150/2500 and 
25/2500 mg, respectively) for 23 days. In both groups, if pain intensity was
rated as > 3 on the VAS at week 1 or 2, the dosage was doubled. The primary end
point was the proportion of patients who achieved pain relief (defined as a score
of > 1 on a 5-point verbal rating scale [VRS] (0 = none; 1 = a little; 2 = some; 
3 = a lot; and 4 = complete) on study days 1 and 2 and weeks 1, 2, and 3. The
secondary end point was the proportion of patients in whom pain was decreased
(VAS score, <- 3 cm). AEs were self-reported on a 4-point VRS (0 = absent; 1 =
mild; 2 = moderate; and 3 = severe).
RESULTS: Of the 121 patients who participated, 59 received C/A and 62 received
H/A. Of the total number of cases, 59% were aged 60 to 89 years, and 55% were
men. At baseline, 88% of the patients described their pain intensity as moderate;
12%, severe. Of the patients who received C/A, 58% responded to the initial
dosage of 150/2500 mg/d, and 8% of the patients responded to the double dosage;
34% did not experience pain relief. In patients with H/A, pain was reported as
absent or mild in 56% of patients at the starting dosage of 25/2500 mg/d; an
additional 15% of the patients responded to the double dosage; the remaining 29% 
of patients did not experience any pain relief. None of the between-group
differences in response rates were significant. The most common AEs in the C/A
and H/A groups were constipation (36% and 29%, respectively), dizziness (24% and 
19%), vomiting (24% and 16%), and dry mouth (15% and 18%), with no significant
differences between groups.
CONCLUSION: In this study, efficacy and tolerability were comparable between C/A 
and H/A over 23 days of treatment in these patients with moderate or severe,
chronic, cancer-related pain.

Radiotherapy (R/T) is frequently used for palliative treatment of painful bone
metastases; however, complete alleviation of pain is not always achieved. This
study was designed to evaluate pain management outcomes and quality of life (QoL)
measures in cancer patients with metastatic bone pain receiving a combination of 
R/T and either transdermal therapeutic fentanyl (TTS-F) patches or
codeine/paracetamol. A total of 460 palliative care patients with bone metastases
who received R/T were enrolled in this prospective, open-label study. The
patients were randomized to initially receive a total dose of 120 mg
codeine/paracetamol per day or TTS-F patches releasing 25 microg fentanyl per
hour. Pain measures were assessed on the basis of selected questions from the
Greek-Brief Pain Inventory. Overall treatment satisfaction (scale, 1 to 4), QoL, 
and European Collaborative Oncology Group status were also recorded. Among the
460 patients, 422 were eligible for evaluation. Pain measures in the TTS-F group 
demonstrated statistically significant improvements during the study that were
superior to those in the codeine/paracetamol group (p < 0.05). Likewise, there
was a significantly greater increase (p < 0.05) in the mean satisfaction score
for patients in TTS-F group at every visit between baseline and month two. The
vast majority (95.8 percent) of patients in the codeine/paracetamol group
increased their medication dosage until the end of the study, whereas in the
TTS-F group the respective percentage was only 6.1. Both treatments were
generally well tolerated, with constipation as the most common side effect
followed by sleep disturbances and nausea. The overall frequencies of side
effects were higher in the codeine/paracetamol group. The results therefore
indicate that TTS-F offers more effective pain relief than codeine/paracetamol,
in combination with R/T, in patients with metastatic bone pain, obtaining
complete treatment satisfaction matched by improvements in their QoL.

With the objective of comparing incidence of adverse events of the opioids
codeine, hydrocodone, and tramadol in the relief of cancer pain, we conducted a
randomized controlled trial in which patients with cancer were randomly assigned 
according to a computer-generated schedule to receive one of the three opioids.
Of the 177 patients who participated, 62 patients received hydrocodone, 59
patients received codeine, and 56 patients received tramadol. The pain
experienced by the participants originated most frequently from the stomach,
breast, or prostate gland and was classified as either somatic (33%), visceral
(52%), mixed (6%), or neuropathic (9%). At the first visit, 60% of the patients
described their pain intensity as moderate (4-6/10), with the remaining 40% of
the patients describing their pain as severe (7-10/10). The symptoms most
associated with pain were weakness, insomnia. and anorexia. In 77% of the total
number of cases, the patient was aware of his/her diagnosis prior to admittance
to the palliative care unit. Of the total number of cases, 57% fell in the age
range of 60-89 years old and 50% of the participants were female. No significant 
statistical difference in the analgesic efficacy of the three opioids was found
(p: 0.69; chi(2): 0.73). Use of tramadol produced higher rates of adverse events 
than codeine and hydrocodone: vomiting, dizziness, loss of appetite, and weakness
(p < 0.05).

We reported earlier that preincisional paravertebral block (PVB) provides
significant immediate postoperative analgesia after breast cancer surgery. In the
same patients (n = 60), a 1-yr follow-up was performed to find out whether PVB
could also reduce the prevalence of postoperative chronic pain. The follow-up
consisted of a 14-day symptom diary and telephone interviews 1, 6, and 12 mo
after surgery. The 14-day consumption of analgesics was similar in the 30 PVB and
the 30 control patients. However, 1 mo after surgery, the intensity of
motion-related pain was lower (P = 0.005) in the PVB group. Six months after
surgery, the prevalence of any pain symptoms (P = 0.029) was lower in the PVB
group. Finally, at 12 mo after surgery, in addition to the prevalence of pain
symptoms (P = 0.003) and the intensity of motion-related pain (P = 0.003), the
intensity of pain at rest (P = 0.011) was lower in the PVB group. These findings 
were independent of whether or not axillary dissection had been performed. The
incidence of neuropathic pain was low (two and three patients in the PVB and
control groups, respectively). In addition to providing acute postoperative pain 
relief, preoperative PVB seems to reduce the prevalence of chronic pain 1 yr
after breast cancer surgery.

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of oxycodone in cancer-related pain, we
conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials. Four studies,
comparing oral oxycodone with either oral morphine (n = 3) or oral hydromorphone 
(n = 1), were suitable for meta-analysis. Standardized mean differences in pain
scores comparing oxycodone with control groups were pooled using random-effects
models. Overall, there was no evidence that mean pain scores differed between
oxycodone and control drugs (pooled standardized mean difference, 0.04; 95%
confidence interval [CI], -0.29 to 0.36; P = .8; I(2) = 62%). In meta-regression 
analyses, pain scores were higher for oxycodone compared with morphine (0.20; 95%
CI, -0.04 to 0.44) and lower compared with hydromorphone (-0.36; 95% CI, -0.71 to
0.00), although these effect sizes were small. The efficacy and tolerability of
oxycodone are similar to morphine, supporting its use as an opioid for
cancer-related pain.

Oxycodone. Pharmacological profile and clinical data in chronic pain management.

Coluzzi F(1), Mattia C.

Author information:

Sapienza University, Rome, Italy. flaminiamail@tiscalinet.it

Opioids are widely used as effective analgesic therapy for cancer pain. Despite
years of controversy, their use has been also accepted in chronic non-cancer
pain. Oxycodone alone and in combination has been used for over 80 years in the
treatment of a variety of pain syndromes. As single agent, the controlled release
(CR) oxycodone's market in the USA grew from 10% in 1996 to 53% in 2000 and it
has become a leading opioid in the United States. Recent data showed that the
fixed-combination oxycodone/acetaminophen (5 mg/325 mg) is the most often
prescribed opioid across all the different chronic pain diagnoses. Compared with 
morphine, oxycodone has a higher oral bioavailability and is about twice as
potent. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data support oxycodone as a
pharmacologically active opiod that does not require conversion to oxymoprhone
for pharmacological activity. Seven studies addressed the safety and efficacy of 
oxycodone for the treatment of non-cancer pain (low back pain, osteoarthritis
pain, and painful diabetic neuropathy). Both immediate release (IR) and CR
oxycodone are equally effective and safe. Along these trials, mean daily dosage
of oxycodone was approximately 40 mg, with a low incidence of intolerable typical
opiate side effects. In cancer pain, oxycodone can be considered a valid
alternative to oral morphine to be used for opioid rotation. No difference in
analgesic efficacy between CR oxycodone and CR morphine was found.
Controlled-release preparations, with a long duration of action, are attractive
because they offer the advantage of longer dosing intervals and sustained
analgesic effect.

Single-injection paravertebral block before general anesthesia enhances analgesia
after breast cancer surgery with and without associated lymph node biopsy.

Hospital, PO Box 580, Helsinki, FIN-00029 HUS, Finland. pekka.kairaluoma@hus.fi

Paravertebral block (PVB) seems to decrease postoperative pain and postoperative 
nausea and vomiting (PONV) after breast surgery, but the studies have not been
placebo controlled. We studied 60 patients scheduled for breast cancer surgery
randomly given single-injection PVB at T3 with bupivacaine 5 mg/mL (1.5 mg/kg) or
saline before general anesthesia. The patient and attending investigators were
blinded; the PVB or the sham block was performed behind a curtain by an
anesthesiologist not involved in the study. The patients given PVB with
bupivacaine needed 40% less IV opioid medication (primary outcome variable) in
the postanesthesia care unit, had a longer latency to the first opioid dose, and 
had less pain at rest after 24 h than the control patients (P < 0.01). They also 
had less PONV in the postanesthesia care unit (P < 0.05), were less sedated until
90 min (P < 0.05), and performed better in the digit symbol substitution test at 
90 min and the ocular coordination test 60-120 min after surgery (P < 0.05). The 
average peak bupivacaine plasma concentration was 750 ng/mL. One patient had
bilateral convulsions immediately after bupivacaine injection. We conclude that
PVB before general anesthesia for breast cancer surgery reduced postoperative
pain, opioid consumption, and occurrence of PONV and improved recovery from
anesthesia.

Efficacy of coeliac plexus and splanchnic nerve blockades in body and tail
located pancreatic cancer pain.

Palliative treatment, pain therapy and quality of life (QOL) are very important
in pancreatic cancer patients. We evaluated the pain relieving efficacy, side
effects and effects on QOL of neurolytic coeliac plexus blockade (NCPB) and
splanchnic nerves neurolytic blockade (SNB) in body and tail located pancreatic
cancer. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. Patients
were randomly divided into two groups. Coeliac group; GC, N = 19 were treated
with coeliac plexus blockade, whereas the patients in splanchnic group; GS, N =
20 were treated with bilateral splanchnic nerve blockade. The VAS values, opioid 
consumption and QOL (Patient satisfaction scale=PSS, performance status scale=PS)
were evaluated prior to the procedure and at 2 weeks intervals after the
procedure with the survival rates. The demographic features were found to be
similar. The VAS differences (difference of every control's value with baseline
value) in GS were significantly higher than the VAS differences in GC on every
control meaning that VAS values in GS decreased more than the VAS values in GC.
GS patients were found to decrease the opioid consumption significantly more than
GC till the 6th control. GS patients had significant improvement in PS values at 
the first control. The mean survival rate was found to be significantly lower in 
GC. Two patients had severe pain during injection in GC and 5 patients had
intractable diarrhoea in GC. Comparing the ease, pain relieving efficacy,
QOL-effects of the methods, splanchnic nerve blocks may be an alternative to
coeliac plexus blockade in patients with advanced body and tail located
pancreatic cancer.

Clinical pharmacology of tramadol.

Grond S(1), Sablotzki A.

Author information:

Stefan.grond@medizin.uni-halle.de

Tramadol, a centrally acting analgesic structurally related to codeine and
morphine, consists of two enantiomers, both of which contribute to analgesic
activity via different mechanisms. (+)-Tramadol and the metabolite
(+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the mu opioid receptor.
(+)-Tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine
reuptake, enhancing inhibitory effects on pain transmission in the spinal cord.
The complementary and synergistic actions of the two enantiomers improve the
analgesic efficacy and tolerability profile of the racemate. Tramadol is
available as drops, capsules and sustained-release formulations for oral use,
suppositories for rectal use and solution for intramuscular, intravenous and
subcutaneous injection. After oral administration, tramadol is rapidly and almost
completely absorbed. Sustained-release tablets release the active ingredient over
a period of 12 hours, reach peak concentrations after 4.9 hours and have a
bioavailability of 87-95% compared with capsules. Tramadol is rapidly distributed
in the body; plasma protein binding is about 20%. Tramadol is mainly metabolised 
by O- and N-demethylation and by conjugation reactions forming glucuronides and
sulfates. Tramadol and its metabolites are mainly excreted via the kidneys. The
mean elimination half-life is about 6 hours. The O-demethylation of tramadol to
M1, the main analgesic effective metabolite, is catalysed by cytochrome P450
(CYP) 2D6, whereas N-demethylation to M2 is catalysed by CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. The
wide variability in the pharmacokinetic properties of tramadol can partly be
ascribed to CYP polymorphism. O- and N-demethylation of tramadol as well as renal
elimination are stereoselective. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic characterisation
of tramadol is difficult because of differences between tramadol concentrations
in plasma and at the site of action, and because of pharmacodynamic interactions 
between the two enantiomers of tramadol and its active metabolites. The analgesic
potency of tramadol is about 10% of that of morphine following parenteral
administration. Tramadol provides postoperative pain relief comparable with that 
of pethidine, and the analgesic efficacy of tramadol can further be improved by
combination with a non-opioid analgesic. Tramadol may prove particularly useful
in patients with a risk of poor cardiopulmonary function, after surgery of the
thorax or upper abdomen and when non-opioid analgesics are contraindicated.
Tramadol is an effective and well tolerated agent to reduce pain resulting from
trauma, renal or biliary colic and labour, and also for the management of chronic
pain of malignant or nonmalignant origin, particularly neuropathic pain. Tramadol
appears to produce less constipation and dependence than equianalgesic doses of
strong opioids.

Establishing the dosage equivalency of oxymorphone extended release and oxycodone
controlled release in patients with cancer pain: a randomized controlled study.

Gabrail NY(1), Dvergsten C, Ahdieh H.

Author information: 
(1)Gabrailoffice@aol.com

OBJECTIVE: To compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of oxymorphone extended
release (ER) and oxycodone controlled release (CR) in patients with moderate to
severe cancer pain.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, 2-period
crossover study included adult outpatients (>or= 18 years of age) with moderate
or severe cancer pain who were first titrated for 3-10 days with open-label
oxymorphone or oxycodone to achieve a stable dose that provided and other
efficacy parameters were comparable for adequate analgesia with tolerable adverse
events and no requirement for more than 2 doses of rescue medication per day. The
subsequent double-blind treatment phase was a 7- to 10-day period of oxycodone CR
or oxymorphone ER treatment followed by crossing over to the alternate medication
for another 7-10 days. During the treatment phase, up to 2 doses per day of
morphine sulfate 15-mg tablets were allowed as rescue.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Assessments included the Brief Pain Inventory, global
evaluations, Karnofsky performance status, and clinical laboratory evaluations
(serum chemistry profile, complete blood count, urinalysis). Efficacy variables
were analyzed using a mixed-effects model with treatment, sequence, and period as
fixed effects and subject as a random effect.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients entered the titration/stabilization phase, 44
received at least 1 dose of study drug, 42 completed the first double-blind
phase, and 40 completed the second double-blind phase. Mean pain intensity scores
the 2 groups. The mean daily dosage of oxycodone CR (91.9 mg) was twice that of
oxymorphone ER (45.9 mg), an equianalgesic dose ratio of 2:1. Rescue medication
use was low in both groups (approximately 1 tablet of morphine sulfate 15
mg/day). No significant differences in opioid adverse events were observed
between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients with cancer who were taking oxycodone CR were readily
converted to oxymorphone ER and required half the milligram dose to stabilize
their pain. Within 72 h, most patients achieved a stable dose that provided
adequate relief with similar opioid adverse events.

Weak opiate analgesics: modest practical merits.

[No authors listed]

(1) The first-line drugs for mild to moderate pain are non opiate analgesics,
namely paracetamol and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). (2) Codeine,
dextropropoxyphene and tramadol are weak opiates; they are often used with
paracetamol in fixed-dose combinations, in order to reinforce the analgesic
effect of paracetamol. (3) These analgesic combinations have only been evaluated 
in a few situations associated with chronic and acute pain. And the endpoints
used in clinical trials are designed more to show statistically significant
differences than clear clinical differences. (4) In acute pain, available
meta-analyses confirm that the first-line drug is paracetamol, or, if necessary, 
ibuprofen, a NSAID. (5) The paracetamol + codeine combination slightly increases 
the analgesic effect of paracetamol, but causes more adverse effects.
Combinations of paracetamol + dextropropoxyphene and paracetamol + tramadol are
even less useful. (6) The few available clinical trials fail to demonstrate that 
combining paracetamol with a NSAID is any more effective than either drug given
alone, while adverse effects are increased. (7) Paracetamol is also the
first-line treatment for chronic non cancer pain, such as low back pain or pain
due to osteoarthritis of the hip. NSAIDs have no advantages over paracetamol in
these settings. We found no trials of paracetamol + NSAID combinations.
Combinations of paracetamol and weak opiates have been inadequately studied in
this situation, and are only second-line options.

Clinical efficacy of controlled-release oxycodone 20 mg administered on a 12-h
dosing schedule on the management of postoperative pain after breast surgery for 
cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical efficacy of controlled-release oxycodone (CRO) 20
mg on a 12-h dosing schedule in this prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled,
double-blinded study of 40 ASA physical status I-III women undergoing breast
surgery for cancer.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: General anaesthesia using remifentanil and propofol 
was performed for surgery. Both groups received premedication with oral midazolam
7.5 mg 1 h before surgery. In the controlled-release oxycodone group, one tablet 
of 20 mg CRO was administered with the premedication, and 12 h after the
premedication another 20 mg CRO. In the placebo (PL) group, a placebo tablet was 
administered with the premedication, and 12 h later another placebo tablet. All
patients had access to opioid rescue medication via an IV patient-controlled
analgesia (PCA) device.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the curve (AUC), based on IV opioid rescue
consumption over 24 h postoperatively.
RESULTS: The AUC for IV PCA opioid consumption was significantly lower in the CRO
group than in the PL group (p = 0.01). The CRO group required less IV opioid
loading dose (p < 0.001), and consumed less opioid rescue medication 4 h (p =
0.036), 16 h (p = 0.01), and 24 h (p = 0.005) postoperatively. AUC for VAS scores
at rest was significantly lower in the CRO group than in the PL group (p = 0.05).
VAS scores at rest were lower in the CRO group 16 h (p = 0.04) and 24 h (p =
0.03) postoperatively. There was no difference in AUC for pain scores on movement
(p = 0.103) and for quality of analgesia (p = 0.139). There was no difference in 
nausea between groups (p = 0.34). Pruritus, arterial hypotension or hypertension,
bradycardia, and tachycardia were not observed in either treatment group. None of
the patients showed signs of confusion, agitation, or respiratory depression.
CONCLUSIONS: The administration of CRO 20 mg on a 12-h dosing schedule halves
postoperative IV PCA opioid consumption. CRO 20mg is effective in preventing pain
after breast surgery for cancer with only mild side-effects.

Thessaloniki, Greece. pipnely@yahoo.com

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of providing analgesia with either transdermal 
fentanyl (TTS-fentanyl) or paracetamol and codeine (P/C) in addition to
radiotherapy in patients with metastatic bone pain.
METHODS: In a prospective study, 26 patients with radiologically confirmed bony
metastases received radiotherapy (R/T). They were randomised to receive either
500 mg paracetamol and 30 mg codeine four times per day (P/C group), or
transdermal fentanyl patches delivering 25 microg fentanyl/h (TTS-fentanyl
group). Pain was assessed using visual analogue pain ratings (VAS) and the Greek 
Brief Pain Inventory (G-BPI) questionnaire administered before R/T and after 3
months.
RESULTS: Data were available from 24 eligible patients. Use of TTS-fentanyl was
associated with significantly superior pain relief. Mean VAS fell from 7.0 to 1.1
with TTS-fentanyl and from 8.3 to 4.3 with P/C, p< 0.01. The TTS-fentanyl group
also showed significantly greater improvements of important G-BPI domains
including global quality of life, pain, and physical, cognitive, and role
functioning, than the P/C group (p< 0.01). Four patients receiving TTS-fentanyl
and three receiving P/C reported severe nausea/vomiting.
CONCLUSIONS: Transdermal fentanyl combined with R/T was more effective in
reducing metastatic bone pain and resulted in greater improvements in quality of 
life than paracetamol and codeine.

Comment in
    Br J Cancer. 2004 May 17;90(10):2049.

The antinociceptive effect of morphine and oxycodone is mediated preferentially
at micro and kappa receptors, respectively. The aim of this study was to evaluate
the analgesic profile of the combination of morphine and oxycodone in cancer
pain, compared to the standard administration of morphine alone.
Controlled-release formulations of oxycodone (CRO) and morphine (CRM) were
compared in 26 patients. The study started with an open-label, randomised
titration phase to achieve stable pain control for 7 days, followed by a
double-blind, randomised crossover phase in two periods, 14 days each. At any
point, patients were allowed to use oral immediate-release morphine (IRM) as
needed, in order to keep visual analogue scale < or =4. Pain, satisfaction,
adverse effects and number of daily rescue morphine tablets were assessed. A
total of 22 patients were evaluated. The weekly upload consumption ratio in
morphine/oxycodone was 1 : 1.8 (1.80, 1.83, 1.76, 1.84). The weekly IRM
consumption was higher in patients having CRM compared to patients having CRO
(ratio morphine/oxycodone: 1.6, 1.6, 1.6, 1.7) (P<0.05). Patients receiving
oxycodone complained of less nausea and vomiting. The rescue morphine analgesic
consumption was 38% higher in patients receiving only morphine, compared to
patients receiving both morphine and oxycodone. The results suggest that the
combination of morphine/oxycodone (opioids with differential preferential sites
of action) can be a useful alternative to morphine alone, resulting in a better
analgesia profile and less emesis.

The role of rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitor, for the treatment
of non-cancer pain: a review.

Fine PG; Department of Anesthesiology, School of Medicine, University of Utah,
Salt Lake City, 84108, USA. fine@aros.net.

Rofecoxib was the first specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) approved
for the treatment of acute pain. It has been shown to provide analgesia that is
significantly better than placebo and has an onset of action and efficacy similar
to that of traditional nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), such as naproxen and ibuprofen. In addition, the analgesic efficacy of 
rofecoxib has been demonstrated to be superior to that of the opioid combination 
of codeine 60 mg/acetaminophen 600 mg in an acute dental pain model. For the
treatment of acute pain, the efficacy of rofecoxib was further demonstrated in a 
study of patients who had undergone orthopedic surgery. Rofecoxib has been found 
to be as effective as naproxen sodium and more effective than placebo in studies 
evaluating its use for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. In patients with
osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee or hip, rofecoxib is superior to placebo and
similar to diclofenac and ibuprofen in relieving OA pain and improving physical
function. Rofecoxib has also been shown to be superior to acetaminophen and
celecoxib after 6 weeks of treatment for OA. The efficacy of rofecoxib has also
been demonstrated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and low back pain. The
advantages of using COX-2-specific NSAIDs include convenient once-daily dosing
schedule and improved safety compared with traditional NSAIDs. Two large outcomes
studies, VIGOR and CLASS, have shown that gastric mucosal ulceration occurs
significantly less often in patients taking COX-2-specific inhibitors than in
those treated with ibuprofen, diclofenac, or naproxen and occurs with a similar
incidence to that of placebo. Absence of any effect on platelet aggregation and
bleeding time further distinguishes these agents from traditional NSAIDs. Because
COX-2-specific inhibitors do not have an antiplatelet effect, they cannot be used
as a substitute for low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis. Rofecoxib is
a safe and highly effective alternative to previously available NSAIDs and should
be considered for the treatment of acute pain conditions in adult patients,
especially those at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications. It is
preferred in the perioperative setting because of its analgesic efficacy and lack
of platelet effects. Because of its more favorable gastrointestinal toxicity
profile compared with nonselective NSAIDs, rofecoxib is safer in patients,
especially older patients, for whom chronic anti-inflammatory or analgesic
therapy is indicated.

OBJECTIVE: The metabolism of dihydrocodeine to dihydromorphine, a high affinity
mu-opioid receptor ligand in membrane homogenates, is catalyzed by CYP2D6.
However, it is not clear whether an active CYP2D6 enzyme is required for opioid
receptor-mediated effects in man after standard dihydrocodeine doses.
METHODS: Whole cell opioid-receptor affinity and effects on cAMP accumulation of 
dihydrocodeine and its metabolites were determined in differentiated SH-SY5Y
neuroblastoma cells. In a double-blind, 2-period, placebo-controlled randomized
crossover pilot study the pharmacokinetics of dihydrocodeine (60 mg single dose) 
and its metabolites were examined in 5 phenotyped extensive (EMs) and 4 poor
metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2D6, and pharmacodynamics were evaluated using a pain
threshold model and dynamic pupillometry.
RESULTS: Displacement binding and cAMP accumulation experiments showed clearly
higher affinities (100- and 50-fold) and activities (180- and 250-fold) of
dihydromorphine and dihydromorphine-6-glucuronide, respectively, whereas the
other metabolites had similar or lower affinities and activities as compared to
dihydrocodeine. The clinical study revealed no significant difference in plasma
or urine pharmacokinetics between EMs and PMs for dihydrocodeine and its
glucuronide. Dihydromorphine and its glucuronides were detectable in EMs only. A 
clear reduction of initial pupil diameters was observed up to 6 hours postdose in
both PMs and EMs, with no obvious differences between CYP2D6 phenotypes. In the
pain threshold model no effects were observed in either group.
CONCLUSION: CYP2D6 phenotype has no major impact on opioid receptor-mediated
effects of a single 60 mg dihydrocodeine dose, despite the essential role of
CYP2D6 in formation of highly active metabolites.

We investigated the analgesic efficacy of mexiletine and gabapentin on acute and 
chronic pain associated with cancer breast surgery in 75 patients. They were
randomized to receive, in a double-blinded manner, mexiletine 600 mg/d,
gabapentin 1200 mg/d, or placebo for 10 days. Anesthesia was standardized, and
all patients had access to routine postoperative analgesics on demand. The visual
analog scale score assessed pain at rest and after movement. Three months later, 
all patients were interviewed to identify intensity of chronic pain and analgesic
requirements. Mexiletine and gabapentin reduced codeine consumed from the second 
to tenth day by 50% (P = 0.029; P = 0.018 and P = 0.035 for mexiletine versus
control and gabapentin versus control comparisons, respectively). Total
paracetamol consumption was also reduced during the same time (P = 0.0085; P =
0.007 and P = 0.011 for the mexiletine and gabapentin groups when compared with
the control, respectively). Pain at rest and after movement was reduced by both
drugs on the third postoperative day. Pain after movement also was reduced by
gabapentin between the second and fifth postoperative day. Three months later,
the incidence of chronic pain, its intensity, and need for analgesics were not
affected by either treatment. However, burning pain was more frequent in the
control group (P = 0.033).IMPLICATIONS: Patients undergoing breast surgery for
cancer may develop chronic pain. We evaluated the effect of mexiletine and
gabapentin on the acute and chronic pain after breast surgery for cancer. Both
drugs reduced the postoperative analgesic requirements, and particularly,
gabapentin reduced pain after movement. The overall incidence of chronic pain was
unaffected except for burning pain.

Greece.

BACKGROUND: Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, suitable for transdermal delivery,
offering an interesting solution as a step 3 opioid in cancer pain treatment. The
purpose of the study was to carefully investigate: 1) the feasibility of the
direct conversion from codeine to TTS fentanyl, in patients already receiving
codeine and requiring strong opioids for their analgesia; 2) the safety of 25
microg/hour incremental steps and at shorter than 72-hour intervals, if
clinically required.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 130 patients were judged eligible for the study. All the
patients were receiving 280-360 mg or more of codeine and required strong opioid 
for their analgesia. The study lasted 56 days. The initial dose was 25
microg/hour. TTS fentanyl for all patients. Data assessments were made on
baseline, day 1, day 2, day 3, in the hospital and thereafter on days 7, 14, 21, 
28, 42 and 56. After the patch application, all the patients were given an
immediate release oral morphine (5 mg) every 4-6 hours for the first 12 hours and
then if needed only as rescue doses. The patients remained in the hospital for
the first three days of the study where follow-up (pain score, satisfaction, side
effects etc.). was recorded by the palliative care team and by daily cards.
RESULTS: The itnitial dose of fentanyl was 25 microg/hour while the mean dose on 
day 3 was 45.9 microg/hour. All the patients required upward titration of the
study medication during follow-up visits. On day 56 the mean dose of fentanyl was
87.4 microg/hour. Mean pain intensity decreased from an initial 5.96 on the
baseline to 0.83 on day 3. Karnofsky scale measurements between treatment phases 
revealed non-significant changes. The rate of overall satisfaction was quite
high. Nine patients discontinued the study due to inadequate pain relief or side 
effects between day 7 and day 28, while five patients died between day 28 and day
56. Constipation, nausea and vomiting were the most common side effects. Skin
reaction was relatively mild and acceptable during the study.
CONCLUSION: Under controlled conditions, TTS fentanyl seems to be feasible for
direct conversion from mild to strong opioids and additionally, 25 microg/hour
incremental steps day by day can be made by palliative care specialists, if
clinically required for cancer pain management.

OBJECTIVE: To establish whether cannabis is an effective and safe treatment
option in the management of pain.
DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases Medline, Embase, Oxford Pain Database, and
Cochrane Library; references from identified papers; hand searches.
STUDY SELECTION: Trials of cannabis given by any route of administration
(experimental intervention) with any analgesic or placebo (control intervention) 
in patients with acute, chronic non-malignant, or cancer pain. Outcomes examined 
were pain intensity scores, pain relief scores, and adverse effects. Validity of 
trials was assessed independently with the Oxford score.
DATA EXTRACTION: Independent data extraction; discrepancies resolved by
consensus.
DATA SYNTHESIS: 20 randomised controlled trials were identified, 11 of which were
excluded. Of the 9 included trials (222 patients), 5 trials related to cancer
pain, 2 to chronic non-malignant pain, and 2 to acute postoperative pain. No
randomised controlled trials evaluated cannabis; all tested active substances
were cannabinoids. Oral delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 5-20 mg, an oral
synthetic nitrogen analogue of THC 1 mg, and intramuscular levonantradol 1.5-3 mg
were about as effective as codeine 50-120 mg, and oral benzopyranoperidine 2-4 mg
was less effective than codeine 60-120 mg and no better than placebo. Adverse
effects, most often psychotropic, were common.
CONCLUSION: Cannabinoids are no more effective than codeine in controlling pain
and have depressant effects on the central nervous system that limit their use.
Their widespread introduction into clinical practice for pain management is
therefore undesirable. In acute postoperative pain they should not be used.
Before cannabinoids can be considered for treating spasticity and neuropathic
pain, further valid randomised controlled studies are needed.

Double-blind, randomized comparison of the analgesic and pharmacokinetic profiles
of controlled- and immediate-release oral oxycodone in cancer pain patients.

Stambaugh JE(1), Reder RF, Stambaugh MD, Stambaugh H, Davis M.

Author information:

Thirty patients with cancer pain completed a double-blind crossover study
comparing controlled-release (CR) and immediate-release (IR) oxycodone. In
open-label titration (2 to 21 days), these patients were stabilized on IR
oxycodone qid. They were then randomized to double-blind treatment with CR
oxycodone q12h or IR oxycodone qid for 3 to 7 days followed by crossover at the
same daily dose. Mean (+/- SD) pain intensity (0 = none to 10 = severe) decreased
from a baseline of 6.0 +/- 2.2 to 2.7 +/- 1.1 after titration with IR oxycodone
dosed qid. Pain intensity remained stable throughout double-blind treatment: 2.7 
+/- 1.9 with CR oxycodone and 2.8 +/- 1.9 with IR oxycodone. Acceptability of
therapy and pain scores correlated with plasma oxycodone concentrations for each 
interval and were similar for both medications (IR and CR oxycodone). Adverse
events were similar for both formulations. Following repeat dosing under
double-blind conditions, oral CR oxycodone administered q12h provided analgesia
comparable to IR oxycodone given qid.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Breast surgery for cancer is associated with chronic
pain and sensory abnormalities. The present study investigates the effect of
regional block, oral mexiletine, and the combination of both, on acute and
chronic pain associated with cancer breast surgery.
METHODS: One hundred patients scheduled for cancer breast surgery received either
regional block with 18 mL of 1% ropivacaine intraoperatively and oral mexiletine 
for the first 6 postoperative days (R + M group), or regional block and placebo
(R + PL), or normal saline instead of ropivacaine and mexiletine (PL + M), or
normal saline and placebo (PL + PL). Postoperative analgesic requirements were
recorded daily. Pain was assessed 0, 3, 6, 9, and 24 hours in the postanesthesia 
care unit (PACU) and on the second to sixth day postoperatively, at rest, and
after movement using the visual analog scale (VAS). Three months after surgery,
patients were interviewed for the presence and intensity of pain, abnormal
sensations, and analgesic requirements.
RESULTS: Regional block reduced the number of intramuscular (IM) injections
required the first 24 hours (P =.05), the R + PL group requiring less injections 
versus the PL + M group (P =.037). Lonarid tablet (paracetamol and codeine)
consumption from the second to the fifth postoperative day differed among the 4
groups (P =.0304), the R + M group requiring fewer tablets than the PL + PL group
(P =.009). Three hours postoperatively, the R + PL group had less pain at rest
when compared with all other groups (P <.05 for all comparisons). On the second
postoperative day, VAS at rest and after movement was less in the R + M versus
the R + PL group (P <.01 and P <.05, respectively). Three months after surgery,
the 4 groups were similar with regard to incidence or intensity of pain or
analgesic requirements. The R + PL group had a lower incidence (77%) of reduced
or absent sensation (P =.016).
CONCLUSIONS: Regional block reduced the analgesic requirements in the early
postoperative period, while mexiletine combined with regional block reduced the
total analgesic requirements during the next 5 postoperative days. Although
chronic pain was not affected by these treatments late-abnormal sensation may be 
diminished by combination of these treatments. Reg Anesth Pain Med

Opioids are increasingly used in the treatment of chronic non-malignant pain. The
aim of this open-label, randomised, parallel group study was to compare analgesia
and side-effects of two commonly used opioid analgesics, tramadol and
dihydrocodeine, in long-acting formulations in 60 osteoarthritis patients with
strong pain despite NSAID's. Dose titration based on effect was performed with
the respective immediate release solutions given additionally to tramadol 100 mg 
bid and dihydrocodeine 60 mg bid during the first 4 days of the 1 month
treatment. Electrical sensation and pain thresholds over the osteoarthritic joint
and at a distant location and gastrointestinal transit times were performed
before and during treatment. Thirty patients with pain controlled by NSAID's
alone formed the comparator group. Pain intensities at rest and during movement
decreased highly significantly with tramadol and dihydrocodeine from median
pre-treatment verbal ratings of over 3 (0=none, 4=unbearable) to 1 and below from
the second treatment day onwards (ANOVA P<0.0001). Pain at rest was significantly
lower with tramadol (ANOVA P=0.04), but ratings were similar during movement.
Mean (95% CI) daily doses on days 1 and 28 were 209 (198-220) mg and 203
(191-206) mg of tramadol, and 129 (122-136) mg and 130 (121-134) mg of
dihydrocodeine, respectively. Minor side-effects were more common with tramadol
(P=0.04). Changes in bowel functions and symptoms were minor with both
treatments, but the frequency of defaecation was lower and stools were harder
with dihydrocodeine. Orocaecal transit time remained unchanged and similar to
controls with both analgesics. Colonic transit times only increased significantly
during treatment with dihydrocodeine. Sensation and pain thresholds were lower
pre-treatment in both groups than in controls and increased during treatment.
These antinociceptive effects were more marked in the tramadol group and distant 
from the osteoarthritic joint. We conclude rapid pain relief was achieved with
both long-acting tramadol and dihydrocodeine with NSAID's in strong
osteoarthritis pain. Minimal dose titration was required and side-effects were
minor. Tramadol interfered less with intestinal function and showed greater
antinociceptive action.

Morphine or oxycodone in cancer pain?

Heiskanen TE(1), Ruismäki PM, Seppälä TA, Kalso EA.

tarja.heiskanen@hus.fi

Oxycodone is an opioid analgesic that closely resembles morphine. Oxymorphone,
the active metabolite of oxycodone, is formed in a reaction catalyzed by CYP2D6, 
which is under polymorphic genetic control. The role of oxymorphone in the
analgesic effect of oxycodone is not yet clear. In this study, controlled-release
(CR) oxycodone and morphine were examined in cancer pain. CR oxycodone and
morphine were administered to 45 adult patients with stable pain for 3-6 days
after open-label titration in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial.
Twenty patients were evaluable. Both opioids provided adequate analgesia. The
variation in plasma morphine concentrations was higher than that of oxycodone,
consistent with the lower bioavailability of morphine. Liver dysfunction affected
selectively either oxycodone or morphine metabolism. Three patients with markedly
aberrant plasma opioid concentrations are presented. Significant individual
variation in morphine and oxycodone metabolism may account for abnormal responses
during treatment of chronic cancer pain.

Jersey 07828-1234, USA. palangm@basf.com

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of
combination hydrocodone 7.5 mg and ibuprofen 200 mg with that of combination
codeine 30 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg for the treatment of chronic pain.
BACKGROUND: Hydrocodone 7.5 mg with ibuprofen 200 mg is the only approved
fixed-dose combination analgesic containing an opioid and ibuprofen.
METHODS: In this randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, repeated-dose,
active-comparator, 4-week, multicenter study, 469 patients were randomly assigned
to receive a 1-tablet (n = 156) or 2-tablet (n = 153) dose of combination
hydrocodone 7.5 mg and ibuprofen 200 mg (HI1 and HI2, respectively) or a 2-tablet
dose of combination codeine 30 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg (CA, n = 160), the
active comparator, every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain. Efficacy was measured
through pain relief scores, number of daily doses of study medication, number of 
daily doses of supplemental analgesics, number of patients who discontinued
therapy due to an unsatisfactory analgesic response, and global assessment
scores.
RESULTS: Of the 469 patients, 255 (54.4%) were female and 214 (45.6%) were male. 
The mean age was 51.1 years. Types of chronic pain included back (214; 45.6%),
arthritic (145; 30.9%), other musculoskeletal (65; 13.9%), cancer (6; 1.3%),
diabetic neuropathic (3; 0.6%), postherpetic neuralgic (5; 1.1%), other
neurologic (21; 4.5%), and other unclassified chronic pain (10; 2.1%). During the
48 hours prior to the study, 351 (74.8%) patients had been treated with opioid or
opioid-nonopioid combination analgesics. The overall mean daily pain relief score
was significantly greater in the HI2 group (2.25+/-0.89) than in the HI1 group
(1.98+/-0.87) (P = 0.003) or the CA group (1.85+/-0.96) (P < 0.001). The overall 
mean number of daily doses of study medication was significantly less in the HI2 
group (2.94+/-0.99) than in the HI1 group (3.23+/-0.76) (P = 0.036) or the CA
group (3.26+/-0.75) (P = 0.014). The overall mean number of daily doses of
supplemental analgesics was significantly less in the HI2 group (0.24+/-0.49)
than in the HI1 group (0.34+/-0.58) (P = 0.021) or CA group (0.49+/-0.85) (P =
0.010). The number of patients who discontinued treatment due to an
unsatisfactory analgesic response was significantly less in the HI2 group (2;
1.3%) than in the CA group (12; 7.5%) (P = 0.008). HI2 was more effective than
HI1 and CA as measured by pain relief scores for week 1 (P < 0.001 vs HI1 and
CA), week 2 (P < 0.001 vs HI1 and CA), and week 3 (P = 0.008 vs HI1 and P < 0.001
vs CA); daily doses of study medication for week 1 (P = 0.019 vs HI1 and P =
0.011 vs CA); daily doses of supplemental analgesics for week 1 (P = 0.010 vs HI1
and CA); and global assessment scores for week 1 (P = 0.018 vs HI1 and P < 0.001 
vs CA), week 2 (P = 0.005 vs HI1 and P < 0.001 vs CA), and week 4 (P = 0.013 vs
HI1 and P = 0.023 vs CA). There were no significant differences between HI1 and
CA in any efficacy variable. There were no significant differences in the number 
of patients experiencing adverse events in the HI2 (127; 83%), HI1 (124; 79.5%), 
and CA (129; 80.6%) groups. However, the mean number of patients who discontinued
treatment due to adverse events was significantly greater in the HI2 group (40;
26.1%) than in the HI1 group (23; 14.7%) (P = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that 2-tablet doses of combination
hydrocodone 7.5 mg and ibuprofen 200 mg may be more effective than either
1-tablet doses of this combination or 2-tablet doses of combination codeine 30 mg
and acetaminophen 300 mg. Moreover, 1-tablet doses of combination hydrocodone 7.5
mg and ibuprofen 200 mg may be as effective as 2-tablet doses of combination
codeine 30 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A significant percentage of women undergoing breast
surgery for cancer may develop neuropathic pain in the chest, and/or ipsilateral 
axilla and/or upper medial arm, with impairment in performing daily occupational 
activities. We designed this study to determine if the perioperative application 
of EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics; AstraZeneca) cream in the breast 
and axilla area reduces analgesic requirements, as well as the acute and chronic 
pain after breast surgery.
METHODS: Forty-six female patients scheduled for breast surgery received randomly
5 g of EMLA or placebo on the sternal area 5 minutes before surgery, and 15 g on 
the supraclavicular area and axilla at the end of the operation. Treatment with
EMLA cream (20 g) or placebo was also applied daily on the 4 days after surgery. 
In the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), 3, 6, 9, and 24 hours after surgery, and 
on the second to sixth day postoperatively, pain was assessed by visual analogue 
scale (VAS) at rest and after movement, and postoperative analgesic requirements 
were recorded. Three months later, patients were asked if they had pain in the
chest wall, axilla and/or medial upper arm, decreased sensation, if they required
analgesics at home, and for the intensity of pain.
RESULTS: Acute pain at rest and with movement did not differ between the EMLA and
control groups, and the analgesics consumed during the first 24 hours were the
same for the EMLA and control groups. However, time to the first analgesia
requirement was longer (P = .04), and codeine and paracetamol consumption during 
the second to fifth days was less (P = .001, and P = .004, respectively) in the
EMLA versus the control group. Three months postoperatively, pain in the chest
wall, axilla, and the total incidence and the intensity of chronic pain were
significantly less in the EMLA versus the control group (P = .004, P = .025, P = 
.002 and P = .003, respectively). The use of analgesics at home and abnormal
sensations did not differ between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of EMLA to patients undergoing breast surgery for
cancer reduced the postoperative analgesic requirements and the incidence and
intensity of chronic pain.

Transdermal fentanyl in opioid-naive cancer pain patients: an open trial using
transdermal fentanyl for the treatment of chronic cancer pain in opioid-naive
patients and a group using codeine.

Vielvoye-Kerkmeer AP(1), Mattern C, Uitendaal MP.

Amsterdam.

To treat cancer pain, physicians often decide to jump directly from step 1 of the
World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder to step 3. The use of
transdermal fentanyl in patients with cancer pain who had either used no opioid
before, or only codeine, is evaluated in the present trial. Both opioid-naive (N 
= 14) and codeine-using (N = 14) patients started with transdermal fentanyl in
the lowest available delivery rate (25 microg/hr). Immediate-release oral
morphine was present as "rescue" medication. Transdermal fentanyl provided good
to excellent pain relief in the majority (68%) of these patients. During the
study, 5 patients continued with 25 microg/hr, and the others used a higher dose.
Clinically relevant respiratory depression was not observed. The common side
effects of opioids were found; constipation was mentioned by 3 patients (11%).
Transdermal fentanyl appeared a safe analgesic in these opioid-naive cancer pain 
patients. In this study, WHO step 2 could be skipped without untoward
complications.

BACKGROUND: Although opioid analgesics have well-defined efficacy and safety in
treatment of chronic cancer pain, further research is needed to define their role
in treatment of chronic noncancer pain.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of controlled-release oxycodone (OxyContin
tablets) treatment on pain and function and its safety vs placebo and in
long-term use in patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain.
METHODS: One hundred thirty-three patients experiencing persistent
osteoarthritis-related pain for at least 1 month were randomized to double-blind 
treatment with placebo (n = 45) or 10 mg (n = 44) or 20 mg (n = 44) of
controlled-release oxycodone every 12 hours for 14 days. One hundred six patients
enrolled in an open-label, 6-month extension trial; treatment for an additional
12 months was optional.
RESULTS: Use of controlled-release oxycodone, 20 mg, was superior (P<.05) to
placebo in reducing pain intensity and the interference of pain with mood, sleep,
and enjoyment of life. During long-term treatment, the mean dose remained stable 
at approximately 40 mg/d after titration, and pain intensity was stable.
Fifty-eight patients completed 6 months of treatment, 41 completed 12 months, and
15 completed 18 months. Common opioid side effects were reported, several of
which decreased in duration as therapy continued.
CONCLUSIONS: Around-the-clock controlled-release oxycodone therapy seemed to be
effective and safe for patients with chronic, moderate to severe,
osteo-arthritis-related pain. Effective analgesia was accompanied by a reduction 
in the interference of pain with mood, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Analgesia
was maintained during long-term treatment, and the daily dose remained stable
after titration. Typical opioid side effects were reported during short- and
long-term therapy.

Can a controlled-release oral dose form of oxycodone be used as readily as an
immediate-release form for the purpose of titrating to stable pain control?

Two separate trials compared controlled-release (CR) oral oxycodone (administered
every 12 hours) with immediate-release (IR) oxycodone (4 times a day) to
determine whether patients with chronic pain could be titrated to stable pain
control as readily with the CR as with the IR formulation. In one study, 48
patients with cancer pain were randomized to open-label titration with either CR 
or IR oxycodone (maximum dose, 400 mg/day) for a period of up to 21 days. In a
study of similar design, 57 patients with low back pain were titrated with either
CR or IR oxycodone (maximum dose, 80 mg/day) for a period of up to 10 days. The
majority of patients in both studies were converted to oxycodone from other
opioid analgesics. Results of both studies showed no difference between CR and IR
oxycodone with respect to both the percentage of patients achieving stable pain
control, the time to achieve stable pain control, and the degree of pain control 
achieved. Among cancer patients, 85% achieved stable analgesia, 92% with the CR
formulation and 79% with the IR formulation. Among noncancer patients, 91%
achieved stable pain control, 87% with the CR formulation and 96% with the IR
formulation. The most commonly reported adverse effects in both studies were
similar for the two formulations and were those anticipated with opioids: nausea,
vomiting, constipation, somnolence, dizziness, and pruritus. Nausea and vomiting 
were the most frequently cited reasons for treatment discontinuations. These
studies suggest that dose titration can be accomplished as readily with oral CR
oxycodone as with IR oxycodone in patients with chronic, moderate to severe pain.

    Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1999 Sep 1;45(2):535.

PURPOSE: In order to better define variables and factors that may influence the
pain response to radiation, and to look for a radiation regimen that can assure
the highest percentage and the longest duration of pain relief, we performed a
prospective, although not randomized, study on patients with bone metastases from
various primary sites.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: From December 1988 to March 1994, 205 patients with a
total of 255 solitary or multiple bone metastases from several primary tumors
were treated in our radiotherapy center with palliative intent. Irradiation
fields were treated with three main fractionation schedules: (1) Conventional
fractionation: 40-46 Gy/20-23 fractions in 5-5.5 weeks; (2) Short course: 30-36
Gy/10-12 fractions in 2-2.3 weeks; (3) Fast course: 8-28 Gy/1-4 consecutive
fractions. Pain intensity was self-assessed by patients using a visual analogic
scale graduated from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the strongest pain one can experience).
Analgesic requirement was assessed by using a five-point scale, scoring both
analgesic strength and frequency (0 = no drug or occasional nonopioids; 1 =
Nonopioids once daily; 2 = Nonopioids more than once daily; 3 = Mild opioids
(oral codeine, pentazocine, etc.), once daily; 4 = Mild opioids more than once
daily; 5 = Strong opioids (morphine, meperidine, etc.). Complete pain relief
meant the achievement of a score < or = 2 in the pain scale or 0 in the analgesic
requirement scale. Partial pain relief indicated a score of 3 to 4 or of 1 to 2
on the former and latter scale, respectively.
RESULTS: Total pain relief (complete + partial) was observed in 195 (76%) sites, 
in 158 of which (62%) a complete response was obtained. Metastases from NSC lung 
tumors appeared to be the least responsive among all primary tumors, with 46%
complete pain relief in comparison to 65% and 83% complete relief in breast (p = 
0.04) and in prostate metastases (p = 0.002), respectively. A significant
difference in pain relief was detected among the several ranges of total dose
delivered to the painful metastases, with 81%, 65%, and 46% complete relief rates
in the 40-46 Gy, 30-36 Gy (p = 0.03), and 8-28 Gy (p = 0.0001) dose ranges
respectively. A straight correlation between total dose and complete pain relief 
was confirmed by the curve calculated by the logistic model which shows that
doses of 30 Gy or more are necessary to achieve complete pain relief in 70% or
more of bone metastases. This correlation holds also for the duration of pain
control, as shown by the actuarial analysis of time to pain progression.
Multivariate analyses, with complete pain relief and time to pain progression as 
endpoints show a highly significant effect of radiation dose (p = 0.0007) and
performance status (p = 0.003), with lower rates of complete pain relief and
shorter time to pain progression observed after smaller radiation total doses or 
higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores.
CONCLUSION: Although single-dose or short course irradiation is an attractive
treatment in reducing the number of multiple visits to radiotherapy departments
for patients with painful bone metastases, it is nevertheless clear that
aggressive protracted treatments seem to offer significant advantages especially 
for patients in whom the expected life span is not short.

To compare the effectiveness and safety of controlled-release (CR) oxycodone
tablets with immediate-release (IR) oxycodone in patients with chronic cancer
pain, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was performed
in 111 patients with cancer pain. Patients were treated with 6 to 12 tablets or
capsules of fixed-combination opioid/nonopioid analgesics per day at study entry.
Patients received 30 mg of CR oxycodone tablets every 12 hr or 15 mg of IR
oxycodone four times daily for 5 days. No titration or supplemental analgesic
medications were permitted. The mean (+/- SE) baseline pain intensity (0 = none, 
1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) was 1.5 +/- 0.1 for the CR
oxycodone-treated group and 1.3 +/- 0.1 for the group given IR oxycodone (P >
0.05). The 5-day mean pain intensity was 1.4 +/- 0.1 and 1.1 +/- 0.1 for the CR
and IR groups, respectively (P > 0.05). Discontinuation rates were equivalent
(33%). There was no significant difference between treatment groups in the
incidence of adverse events. This study demonstrates that cancer pain patients
given 6 to 12 tablets or capsules of fixed-dose combination analgesics can be
equally well treated with CR oxycodone administered every 12 hr or IR oxycodone
four times daily at the same total daily dose. CR oxycodone offers the benefits
of twice daily dosing.

Comparison of controlled-release and immediate-release oxycodone tablets in
patients with cancer pain.

NY, USA.

PURPOSE: This study compared the clinical efficacy of oxycodone hydrochloride
controlled-release (CR) tablets administered every 12 hours with
immediate-release (IR) oxycodone tablets administered four times daily in
patients with cancer-related pain.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer patients who required therapy for moderate to severe
pain were randomized to CR oxycodone every 12 hours (n=81) or IR oxycodone four
times daily (n=83) for 5 days in a multicenter, double-blind study. Pain
intensity was assessed four times daily (categorical scale of none, slight,
moderate, and severe); acceptability of therapy was assessed twice daily
(categorical scale of very poor, poor, fair, good, and excellent).
RESULTS: Pain intensity remained slight during the study, with mean oxycodone
doses of 114 mg/d (range, 20 to 400 mg/d) for CR and 127 mg/d (range, 40 to 640
mg/d) for IR. Acceptability of therapy was fair to good with both treatments.
While standard conversion ratios provided an acceptable dose for many patients, a
protocol amendment that allowed initial titration and use of rescue medication
reduced the discontinuation rate for lack of acceptable pain control (from 34% to
4% with CR and from 31% to 19% with IR before and after amendment, respectively) 
without increasing the discontinuation rate for adverse events (from 8% to 7%
with CR and from 13% to 11% with IR). Fewer adverse events were reported with CR 
(109) than with IR (186) oxycodone (P=.006).
CONCLUSION: CR oxycodone every 12 hours was as effective as IR oxycodone four
times daily in managing moderate to severe cancer-related pain and was associated
with fewer reports of adverse events.

PURPOSE: Use of oxycodone for chronic cancer pain has been hampered by its short 
elimination half-life. This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety
of controlled-release formulations of oxycodone and morphine for cancer pain.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two adult patients with cancer pain and a > or =
3-day history of stable analgesia with oral opioids provided written informed
consent and were randomized to controlled-release oxycodone or controlled-release
morphine for 7 days. To blind the study using available tablet strengths, the
dose ratio of oxycodone to morphine was set at 1:1.5. On day 8, patients were
crossed over to the alternate drug for 7 days. Pain intensity was assessed using 
a visual analog scale (VAS 0 to 100 mm) and a categorical scale (CAT 0 to 4).
Side effects were assessed using a checklist (four-point categorical severity)
and a nondirected questionnaire. Patients and investigators made blinded global
ratings of efficacy and treatment preference.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients completed the study (10 men, 13 women). The VAS
and CAT scores were (mean+/-SD) 23+/-21 and 1.2+/-0.8 on controlled-release
oxycodone, and 24+/-20 (P=.43) and 1.3+/-0.7 (P=.36) on controlled-release
morphine. No period or carryover effect was detected. There were no significant
differences in adverse effects (P=.40) or ratings of efficacy and preference. The
median oxycodone/morphine dose ratio was 1.5 and the maximum was 2.3.
CONCLUSION: Controlled-release oxycodone is as safe and effective as
controlled-release morphine in the treatment of cancer pain.

Efficacy and safety of levodropropizine and dihydrocodeine on nonproductive cough
in primary and metastatic lung cancer.

Nonproductive cough is a frequent and distressing symptom in patients with lung
cancer, and it is not even relieved by palliative chemotherapy. A double-blind,
randomized clinical trial regarding the treatment of nonproductive cough was
performed in 140 adults with primary lung cancer or metastatic cancer of the
lungs. The therapeutic efficacy and the tolerability of a 7-day treatment with
levodropropizine drops (75 mg t.i.d.) were evaluated in comparison with
dihydrocodeine drops (10 mg t.i.d.; 7 days). Efficacy was assessed on the basis
of cough severity scores, number of night awakenings due to cough, and overall
estimate of antitussive efficacy. Tolerability was evaluated by laboratory
results, vital signs and any adverse event occurring during the clinical trial,
including presence or absence of somnolence. Subjective cough severity was
significantly reduced during treatment with either levodropropizine and
dihydrocodeine, the antitussive effect and its time-profile being similar for
both drugs. Also, according to the investigator's evaluation, both
levodropropizine and dihydrocodeine produced a significant decrease in cough
severity. Concurrently with the relief of cough, the number of night awakenings
was decreased significantly by both drugs, with no difference between the two
treatments. No change in laboratory test values was considered clinically
relevant, and vital signs were not clinically affected. The number of patients
reporting adverse events was similar in the levodropropizine (n=6) and
dihydrocodeine (n=4) group. However, the percentage of patients experiencing
somnolence in the group receiving levodropropizine (8%) was significantly lower
as compared with that of the dihydrocodeine group (22%). These results confirm
the antitussive effectiveness of levodropropizine and suggest a more favourable
benefit/risk profile when compared to dihydrocodeine.

Double-blind evaluation of short-term analgesic efficacy of orally administered
diclofenac, diclofenac plus codeine, and diclofenac plus imipramine in chronic
cancer pain.

A prospective double-blind randomized trial was conducted on 184 cancer patients 
with moderate to severe chronic pain to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and
tolerability of diclofenac alone (50 mg q.i.d.) or in combination with a weak
opioid (codeine 40 mg q.i.d.), or with an anti-depressant (imipramine, 10 or 25
mg t.i.d.). All demographic and clinical characteristics including cancer type,
presence of bone metastases, baseline pain severity, neuropathic and nociceptive 
pain, and depressive state, were well balanced between the three treatment
groups. The main analysis of the study was on the VAS scores at visit 2 (day 4). 
The mean VAS values for both associations imipramine plus diclofenac and codeine 
plus diclofenac were similar to the association placebo plus diclofenac. Patients
on imipramine plus diclofenac and on placebo plus diclofenac were withdrawn
mainly for inadequate efficacy, while patients on codeine plus diclofenac
discontinued equally for inadequate efficacy or adverse events. In conclusion, in
a short-term evaluation the addition of a tricyclic anti-depressant or a weak
opioid to diclofenac did not provide further analgesia with respect to diclofenac
administration alone.

Controlled-release oxycodone and morphine in cancer related pain.

Heiskanen T(1), Kalso E.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anaesthesia, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland.

Controlled-release (CR) formulations of oxycodone and morphine were compared in
45 patients with chronic cancer pain. The study was started with an open-label,
randomised titration phase to achieve stable pain control for at least 48 h,
followed by a double-blind, randomised, crossover phase in two periods, 3-6 days 
each. To blind the study using available tablet strengths, the dose ratio of
oxycodone to morphine was set at 2:3. A daily telephone contact was maintained
between the patient and the investigator. The patients were asked to assess pain 
intensity four times a day and acceptability of therapy twice daily, and to
record possible adverse effects. Pharmacodynamic evaluations were performed at
the end of each double-blind period. The patients were allowed to use escape
analgesic (respective opioid as oral solution) as needed. Twenty-seven patients
were evaluable for both safety and efficacy. Pain was well-controlled during both
stable phases. When the period effect was taken into account the two opioids
provided comparable analgesia. If the results of the two periods were combined,
the patients consumed significantly more escape doses and the mean pain
intensities were significantly greater with CR oxycodone. The total opioid
consumption ratio of oxycodone to morphine was 2:3 when oxycodone was
administered first, and 3:4 when oxycodone was administered after morphine. The
total incidence of adverse experiences reported by the patients was similar, but 
significantly more vomiting occurred with morphine, whereas constipation was more
common with oxycodone.

Comparative clinical efficacy and safety of a novel controlled-release oxycodone 
formulation and controlled-release hydromorphone in the treatment of cancer pain.

Hagen NA(1), Babul N.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, The University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The use of oxycodone to treat chronic cancer pain has been hampered
by its short elimination half-life, which necessitates administration every 4
hours. This study compared the clinical efficacy and safety of a novel oxycodone 
formulation with that of hydromorphone in the treatment of cancer pain.
METHODS: In a double-blind crossover study, 44 patients with stable cancer pain
were randomized to controlled-release oxycodone or controlled-release
hydromorphone, each given every 12 hours for 7 days. Pain intensity, nausea, and 
sedation were assessed by patients four times daily, and breakthrough analgesia
was recorded.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients completed the study (18 women, 13 men; mean age, 56 
+/- 3 years) and received a final controlled-release oxycodone dose of 124 +/- 22
mg per day and a final controlled-release hydromorphone dose of 30 +/- 6 mg per
day. There were no significant differences between treatments in overall Visual
Analogue Scale (VAS) pain intensity (VAS 28 +/- 4 mm vs. 31 +/- 4 mm),
categorical pain intensity (1.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.1), daily rescue analgesic 
consumption (1.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.3), sedation scores (24 +/- 4 mm vs. 18
+/- 3 mm), nausea scores (15 +/- 3 mm vs. 13 +/- 3 mm), or patient preference.
Two patients experienced hallucinations on controlled-release hydromorphone, but 
none did while receiving controlled-release oxycodone.
CONCLUSIONS: Controlled-release oxycodone demonstrated excellent pharmacodynamic 
characteristics, analgesic efficacy, and safety as compared with
controlled-release hydromorphone and represents an important new therapeutic
option for cancer pain management.

Systematic review of outpatient services for chronic pain control.

AIM OF REPORT. This report reviews the evidence about the effectiveness of
treatments for chronic pain. While treatment of chronic pain is usually seen as
an integrated service, this report concentrates on the individual interventions
that constitute the service. HOW THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED. Searches of
databases and journals identified over 15,000 randomised studies with pain as an 
outcome, and many more which were not randomised. Over 150 systematic reviews
relevant to chronic pain treatment were identified and their quality assessed
using a simple scoring system. Systematic reviews conducted for this report were 
based mainly on randomised trials. The number needed to treat (NNT) was chosen as
the output for the report. NNTs of 2-4 indicate effective treatments. Because NNT
is treatment-specific it overcomes problems associated with highly variable
placebo or control event rates in pain trials. Such variability is predominantly 
due to the limited numbers of patients in the clinical trials. Dichotomous
outcome measures are important in synthesising information from many studies, and
in deriving NNTs. Methods have been developed which allow mean information on
pain relief and intensity to be converted reliably into the simple dichotomous
outcome of at least 50% pain relief. RESEARCH FINDINGS. PHYSICAL INTERVENTIONS.
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been shown not to be
effective in postoperative and labour pain. In chronic pain, there is evidence
that TENS effectiveness increases slowly, and that large doses need to be used.
There is lack of evidence for the effectiveness of TENS in chronic pain. There is
a lack of evidence for the effectiveness of relaxation. Intravenous systemic
regional blockade with guanethidine has been shown to be without effect. Epidural
corticosteroids are effective in the short term for back pain and sciatica.
Injections of corticosteroids in or around shoulder joints for shoulder pain have
been shown not to be effective. There is a lack of evidence supporting spinal
cord stimulators. Case series are of poor quality and do not provide evidence of 
effectiveness, although at least 50% pain relief at 5 years is reported in over
50% of patients. PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS. Minor analgesics are important in
chronic pain. NNTs were calculated for analgesics given orally for moderate or
severe acute postoperative pain. The NNTs found ranged from 17 (poor) for
codeine, 60 mg, to 2.5 (good) for ibuprofen, 400 mg. Anticonvulsant and
antidepressant drugs are prescribed for neuropathic pains like diabetic
neuropathy. NNTs are of the order of 2.5, showing them to be effective
treatments. However, there are too few studies with too few patients to determine
which is the best drug. Minor adverse events are common, and major adverse events
occur in about 1 in 20 patients. There are no studies comparing antidepressants
and anticonvulsants directly. Systemic local anaesthetic-type drugs have been
shown to be effective in nerve injury pain but there is little or no evidence to 
support their use in migraine or cancer-related pain. Topical NSAIDs (for
example, gels, creams) are effective in rheumatological conditions with an
overall NNT of 3. There are too few studies to determine which is the best agent.
Topical NSAIDs have few adverse events; most importantly they are without the
major gastrointestinal adverse events found with oral NSAIDs, which might make
them an important choice for some patients with peripheral arthritis. (ABSTRACT

Randomised trial of oral morphine for chronic non-cancer pain.

Author information:

London, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The use of opioid analgesics for chronic non-cancer pain is
controversial. Some surveys report good pain relief and improvement in
performance while others suggest a poor outcome with a propensity to
psychological dependence or addiction.
METHODS: We undertook a randomised double-blind crossover study to test the
hypothesis that oral morphine relieves pain and improves the quality of life in
patients with chronic regional pain of soft tissue or musculoskeletal origin who 
have not responded to codeine, anti-inflammatory agents, and antidepressants.
Morphine was administered as a sustained-release preparation in doses up to 60 mg
twice daily and compared with benztropine (active placebo) in doses up to 1 mg
twice daily over three-week titration, six-week evaluation, and two-week washout 
phases. Pain intensity, pain relief, and drug liking were rated weekly and
psychological features, functional status, and cognition were assessed at
baseline and at the end of each evaluation phase.
FINDINGS: After dose titration in the 46 patients who completed the study, the
mean daily doses of drugs were morphine 83.5 mg and benztropine 1.7 mg. On visual
analogue scales, the morphine group showed a reduction in pain intensity relative
to placebo in period I (p = 0.01) and this group also fared better in a crossover
analysis of the sum of pain intensity differences from baseline (p = 0.02). No
other significant differences were detected.
INTERPRETATION: In patients with treatment-resistant chronic regional pain of
soft-tissue or musculoskeletal origin, nine weeks of oral morphine in doses up to
120 mg daily may confer analgesic benefit with a low risk of addiction but is
unlikely to yield psychological or functional improvement.

Codeine is widely used in combination with acetaminophen and aspirin for the
management of mild to moderate pain. However, there are few controlled clinical
trials of single-entity codeine in chronic cancer pain. The purpose of this study
was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of controlled-release codeine
given every 12 hr in patients with cancer pain. Thirty-five patients with chronic
cancer pain were randomized in a double-blind crossover study to
controlled-release (CR) codeine or placebo, for 7 days each. Pain intensity was
assessed at 0800 hr and 2000 hr using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a
five-point categorical scale, and the use of "rescue" acetaminophen-plus-codeine 
(300 mg/30 mg every 4 hr as needed) was recorded. Thirty patients completed the
study (17 male, 13 female; mean age, 64.4 +/- 9.8 years) with a mean daily CR
codeine dose of 277 +/- 77 mg (range, 200-400 mg). CR codeine treatment resulted 
in significantly lower overall VAS pain intensity scores (22 +/- 18 mm versus 36 
+/- 20 mm, P = 0.0001), categorical pain intensity scores (1.2 +/- 0.8 versus 1.8
+/- 0.8, P = 0.0001), and pain scores when assessed by day of treatment and by
time of day. Daily "rescue" analgesic consumption was significantly lower on CR
codeine, compared to placebo treatment (2.2 +/- 2.3 versus 4.6 +/- 2.8 tablets
per day, P = 0.0001). Both patients and investigators preferred CR codeine to
placebo (80% versus 3%, P = 0.0014 and 73% versus 7%, P = 0.0160, respectively). 
These data indicate that CR codeine, given every 12 hr results in significant
reductions in pain intensity and the use of "rescue" acetaminophen-plus-codeine
in patients with cancer pain. CR codeine provides the benefits of a flexible

Treatment decisions for the use of opioid analgesics in chronic non-malignant
pain are based primarily on survey data, as evidence from well-controlled
clinical trials has been lacking. Forty-six patients with chronic non-malignant
pain were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation
of controlled-release (CR) codeine. Following a 3-7-day diary familiarization
period, patients were randomly assigned to 7 days of treatment each with CR
codeine q12h or placebo. The CR codeine dose was determined from the consumption 
of acetaminophen+codeine in the 7 days preceding the study. During both phases,
breakthrough pain was treated with acetaminophen+codeine every 4 h as required.
Pain intensity was assessed at 08:00 h and 20:00 h using a visual analogue scale 
(VAS) and a 5-point categorical scale, and rescue analgesic consumption was
recorded at the time of use. Thirty patients (17 female, 13 male; mean age: 55.1 
+/- 13.4 years) completed the study and were treated with a mean daily CR codeine
dose of 273 +/- 78 mg (range: 200-400 mg). CR codeine treatment resulted in
significantly lower overall VAS pain intensity scores (35 +/- 18 vs. 49 +/- 16, P
= 0.0001), categorical pain intensity scores (1.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.6, P =
0.0001), and in pain scores by day of treatment and by time of day. Daily rescue 
analgesic consumption was significantly lower on CR codeine, relative to placebo 
treatment (3.6 +/- 3.5 vs. 6.1 +/- 3.2 tablets/day, P = 0.0001). There was also a
significant reduction in the Pain Disability Index (PDI) on CR codeine, compared 
to placebo (25.0 +/- 7.7 vs. 35.1 +/- 8.2, P = 0.0001). Patients' and
investigators' blinded treatment preference was significantly in favor of CR
codeine, relative to placebo (73% vs. 10%, P = 0.0160 and 80% vs. 7%, P = 0.0014,
respectively). The incidence of nausea was significantly higher on CR codeine
than on placebo (32.6% vs. 11.9%, P = 0.013). Ninety-three percent of patients
completing the study requested long-term, open-label treatment with CR codeine.
Pain intensity scores at the completion of 19 weeks of long-term evaluation were 
comparable to those during the double-blind CR codeine treatment. We conclude
that treatment with CR codeine results in reduced pain and pain-related
disability in patients with chronic non-malignant pain.

Switzerland.

Compared with other European countries, French laws and restrictions concerning
the use of opioids are of medium severity only. Still, together with Germany,
Belgium and Spain, France belongs to the group of countries with a low national
consumption of morphine, calculated by the International Narcotics Control Board 
of United Nations. In order to elucidate the current practice of French
physicians treating cancer pain, a questionnaire study was carried out, using the
nationwide register of general practitioners and specialists of a pharmaceutical 
company. The knowledge of the principles and methods of cancer pain treatment
were evaluated with 9 open and 19 multiple-choice questions. The ability of the
physicians to apply their knowledge in practice was evaluated by analyzing their 
suggested treatment of 3 illustrative case histories. The favourite drugs in
treating cancer pain were strong opioid agonists, suggested by 25% of the general
practitioners and 44% of the specialists for a typical cancer pain patient. The
recommended daily doses of opioids were mostly far below the level generally
accepted in palliative care. The drug of choice for metastatic bone pain was a
combination of paracetamol and codeine, chosen by a third of the general
practitioners. Consequently, only 10% and 21% of the treatment suggestions were
regarded as adequate. Ninety-two percent of the physicians experienced
difficulties in the treatment of cancer pain, inefficacy of treatment being the
most important problem.

We conducted a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group study to compare the
clinical efficacy of a new antitussive drug, moguisteine (100 mg t.i.d.), to that
of a reference standard, codeine (15 and 30 mg, t.i.d.). Both drugs were given
orally for a period of two days. A group of 119 patients (mean age 54 yrs; 61
females and 58 males) with chronic, dry or slightly productive cough, associated 
with various respiratory disorders (including chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, respiratory malignancies and pulmonary fibrosis) were enrolled at six
participating centres. The percentage reduction in the number of morning coughs
over a period of 6 h after the first administered dose compared to baseline
assessment, was 21% with moguisteine (n = 39), 28% with codeine 15 mg (n = 38),
and 29% with codeine 30 mg (n = 36). Differences between treatments were not
significant. The percentage reduction in the number of nocturnal coughs per hour,
after the last evening dose compared to baseline assessment, was 33, 46 and 52%, 
respectively. Subjective assessments (patients' visual analogue scale scores of
cough frequency, cough intensity and sleep disturbance, and investigators'
ranking of cough severity) indicated that there was a similar improvement in
cough symptoms in all treatment groups. Adverse events were observed in two
patients on moguisteine, three on codeine 15 mg, and five on codeine 30 mg. No
event was serious, but discontinuation of treatment was required in two patients 
on codeine 30 mg. The results of our study suggest that moguisteine 100 mg t.i.d.
is safe, and seems to have an antitussive activity similar to that of codeine
15-30 mg t.i.d.

A randomized cross-over study of the efficacy of codeine phosphate versus
Ispaghulahusk in patients with gynaecological cancer experiencing diarrhoea
during pelvic radiotherapy.

Lodge N, Evans ML, Wilkins M, Blake PR, Fryatt I.

Diarrhoea is the commonest acute complication during radiotherapy treatment to
the pelvis. Codeine phosphate and a low residue diet is the standard therapy for 
radiation-induced diarrhoea at The Royal Marsden NHS Trust. The hypothesis put
forward was that Ispaghulahusk and codeine phosphate were equally effective in
the treatment of diarrhoea during radiotherapy. Participants in the study were
female patients who had experienced change of bowel habit whilst receiving
radiotherapy for their gynaecological cancer. Quantitative data was collected
from patient diaries and treatment flow-sheets. Ten patients were randomized into
the trial, five to codeine phosphate, and five to Ispaghulahusk. Continuing the
trial was questioned after 10 patients had been treated. All five patients in the
codeine phosphate arm received adequate control, while the five patients
allocated to the Ispaghulahusk arm were all crossed-over to codeine phosphate
with resolution of their diarrhoea. The results show that Ispaghulahusk, whilst
not totally ineffective at controlling diarrhoea, was significantly less
effective than codeine phosphate. Our conclusion is that there is insufficient
reason to change to a less effective and less palatable preparation for the
control of radiation-induced diarrhoea.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxycodone when given intravenously and
rectally to adult patients with cancer pain.

Leow KP(1), Cramond T, Smith MT.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery, University of Queensland, Royal Brisbane Hospital,
Australia.

The single-dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxycodone administered
by the intravenous and rectal routes were determined in 12 adult cancer patients 
with moderate to severe cancer pain (visual analog scale [VAS] score,
approximately 5). Oxycodone was administered by the intravenous and rectal routes
with open drug administration and a cross-over design. After single-dose
intravenous administration (7.9 +/- 1.5 mg, mean +/- SD), the mean (+/- SD)
terminal half-life was 3.4 h (+/- 1.1), the mean (+/- SD) plasma clearance was
45.4 L/h (+/- 10.1), and the mean (+/- SD) volume of distribution in the terminal
phase was 3.0 L/kg (+/- 1.1). After rectal oxycodone (30 mg), the mean (+/- SD)
absorption lag time was 0.52 h (+/- 0.29) and the mean (+/- SD) absolute
bioavailability was 61.6% (+/- 30.2%). Intravenous oxycodone was associated with 
a rapid onset of pain relief (5-8 min) in contrast to the 0.5- to 1.0-h delay
observed after rectal administration. However, rectal oxycodone provided
analgesia of much longer duration (approximately 8-12 h) than did intravenous
oxycodone (approximately 4 h). There were no significant differences (P > 0.05)
in the incidence and severity of side effects between intravenous and rectal
oxycodone. The marked interindividual variation observed in the pharmacokinetics 
and pharmacodynamics of oxycodone in this study emphasizes the need for
individualized dosing regimens.

INTRODUCTION: In 1986 the World Health Organisation (WHO) proposed an analgesic
ladder for the effective therapy of cancer pain. The three standard analgesics
making up this ladder are aspirin (non-opioid), codeine (weak opioid) and
morphine (strong opioid). Adjuvant drugs may be added at any level. However,
before 1986 step II analgesics (weak opioids) had never been tested in cancer
pain relief.
METHODS: This report presents a computer-assisted Medline (US National Library of
Medicine) literature search restricted to the years 1986-1994, which was
conducted to test the validity of the WHO guidelines, and in particular that of
step II.
RESULTS: We found seven retrospective studies and one prospective study on cancer
pain treatment according to the proposed WHO guidelines that had been published
since 1986. Every publication decribed the use of all three steps of the
analgesic ladder. We found no prospective controlled trials demonstrating the
efficacy and safety of WHO step II in particular.
DISCUSSION: The use of the WHO guidelines "by mouth, by the clock and by the
ladder" is now the mainstay of cancer pain management. Because of the guidelines'
simplicity they found general acceptance and helped to establish an international
pain therapy standard for worldwide use. Nevertheless, there is no scientific
validation of WHO step II. In the absence of prospective controlled randomized
trials additional longterm results are necessary. We need more data on the use of
WHO step II and an update of the published guidelines taking account of modern
sustained-release drugs. Up to now, step II of the WHO guidelines for cancer pain
is not a clinical reality but at best a didactic instrument.

The dose-response relationship of controlled-release codeine (Codeine Contin) in 
chronic cancer pain.

The improved pain control provided by regular dosing of opioid analgesics in
patients with severe cancer pain has been well established. However, the
treatment of mild-to-moderate cancer pain is often limited to "as needed" dosing 
with fixed combinations of codeine or oxycodone plus a nonopioid analgesic, which
do not allow optimal titration of the individual components. This randomized
double-blind study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of controlled-release
codeine (Codeine Contin) in patients with cancer pain, and to estimate its dose
equivalence to a standard combination of acetaminophen plus codeine. Twenty-four 
patients with at least moderate cancer pain were randomized to Codeine Contin
100, 200, or 300 mg every 12 hr or acetaminophen plus codeine (600 mg/60 mg)
every 6 hr. On days 1 and 4 of dosing, pain intensity and pain relief were
assessed hourly for 12 hr. The sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) from
baseline and the total pain relief (TOTPAR) scores demonstrated a dose-response
relationship for Codeine Contin on days 1 and 4 that was statistically
significant on day 1 and suggested greater analgesic efficacy on day 4, compared 
with day 1. Codeine Contin 150 mg every 12 hr was estimated to be equianalgesic
to acetaminophen plus codeine (600 mg/60 mg) given every 6 hr. Because a similar 
equivalence was also demonstrated from analysis of adverse event data, it is
concluded that Codeine Contin 150 mg produces analgesia and a side-effect profile
similar to a 40% lower dose of codeine provided by the combination.(ABSTRACT

Flupirtine. A review of its pharmacological properties, and therapeutic efficacy 
in pain states.

Friedel HA(1), Fitton A.

Author information: 
(1)Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand.

Flupirtine is a novel non-opiate centrally acting analgesic agent with muscle
relaxant properties, advocated for use in a number of pain states. Preliminary
evidence suggests that flupirtine 100 to 200mg orally or 150mg rectally 3 to 4
times daily (maximum daily dose 600mg) is more effective than placebo in
relieving moderate acute pain of various types. For the relief of pain due to
surgery, traumatic injury, dental procedures, headache/migraine and abdominal
spasms, flupirtine has proved at least as effective as the opiate analgesics
codeine, dihydrocodeine and pentazocine, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
agents suprofen, diclofenac and ketoprofen, as well as dipyrone and paracetamol
(acetaminophen). Although evidence to support a role in the treatment of chronic 
pain is limited, flupirtine has been found as effective as pentazocine in short
term trials of patients with muscular or neuralgiform pain, dysmenorrhoea, soft
tissue rheumatism or cancer pain. The safety profile of flupirtine has not yet
been fully established, although initial evidence suggests that adverse
reactions, while frequent, are usually minor in nature. The most common reactions
are drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth and various gastrointestinal complaints. In 
comparison with opiate drugs, flupirtine appears to produce fewer central nervous
system effects, no respiratory or cardiovascular depression, and no overt
tolerance or physical dependence on prolonged administration. If these initially 
favourable results are confirmed in larger long term trials, then flupirtine
would appear to represent an effective analgesic for the relief of moderate pain,
particularly that of musculoskeletal origin.

[Drug therapy in severe tumor pain. Comparative study of a new combination
preparation versus diclofenac-Na].

[Article in German]

Strobel E.

In a multicentric, interindividual, double-blind study, the analgesic action,
duration of effect, tolerability and side effects of the new combination
preparation, Combaren (diclofenac-Na 50 mg+codeine phosphate 50 mg), were
compared with those of diclofenac-Na 50 mg (Voltaren 50) in 184 patients with
severe tumor-related pain. The results show that Combaren is a highly effective
preparation for the treatment of severe tumor pain. The combination of
diclofenac-Na with codeine phosphate leads to a clear, statistically significant,
augmentation of the effectiveness of additionally used analgesics on pain
severity, and the general effectiveness of the combination is more positively
assessed that that of monotherapy with diclofenac (also effective). In the staged
approach to the treatment of malignancy-related pain in which the aim is to
provide continuous, preventive analgesia rather than ad hoc treatment of newly
developing or worsening pain, this combination preparation will presumably find a
permanent place in stage I/II of the generally accepted staged pain-treatment
scheme.

A clinical study on the use of codeine, oxycodone, dextropropoxyphene,
buprenorphine, and pentazocine in cancer pain.

De Conno F, Ripamonti C, Sbanotto A, Barletta L, Zecca E, Martini C, Ventafridda 
V.

The authors report a prospective study on 944 cancer pain patients treated with
one of the following opioids: codeine, oxycodone, dextropropoxyphene,
buprenorphine, and pentazocine. Level of analgesia, duration of treatment, side
effects, and drop out were evaluated for each drug. Twenty-four percent of the
patients still benefitted from treatment at the fourth week of study, even if
high drug dosages were not used. Pentazocine did not show an evident analgesic
effect during the first 2 wk of treatment. The other opioids were found to be
valid therapeutic instruments for chronic cancer pain control in a limited number
of patients.

Mast cells and histamine-mediated reactions may be altered in patients with
cancer. In an attempt to characterize the possible skin defects in patients with 
cancer, we tested 22 patients suffering from lung cancers, 30 from breast
cancers, and 30 age-matched normal individuals, using several compounds, in
investigating the pathophysiology of the skin response. Histamine hydrochloride
(10 and 100 mg/ml) and codeine phosphate (9%) were tested by prick test.
Substance P (50 and 500 ng per injection site), phentolamine (20 micrograms per
injection site), and carbachol (1 microgram per injection site) were tested by
intradermal skin tests. Skin mast cells were also microscopically examined in 10 
patients with lung cancer, five with breast cancer, and 10 normal subjects. The
mean wheal sizes induced by all the tested substances were similar in patients
with cancer and chronic bronchitis and in normal individuals. The flare to
histamine, codeine phosphate, and substance P was completely abolished in 7/22
patients with lung cancer, but the lack of flare was not related to the age of
the patients, nor to the staging of cancer, nor to metastasis. The mean numbers
of alcian blue-stained or toluidine blue-stained positive mast cells were similar
in normal subjects and in subjects with cancer. This study does not confirm the
skin hyporeactivity of patients with cancer.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, Medical Faculty, Palacký University, Olomouc.

Human pain studies require a multidimensional evaluation for the complex
understanding of the stated problem. For this reason, not only the subjective
verbal evaluations but also objective indices are considered. To estimate the
latter ones, autonomic, vasomotor and electrodermal responses to electric
stimulation were selected in the presented study together with the verbal
assessment. In comparison with the chronic non-malignant pain patients, different
findings were obtained in healthy subjects, both in the objective and subjective 
indices. In the second part of the study, the analgesic effects of
acetylsalicylic acid or codeine or placebo were compared under indentical
experimental conditions. The differences were less impressive than those found in
the first part of the study. The antinociceptive effect was registered only after
codeine administration.

Morphine and oxycodone in the management of cancer pain: plasma levels determined
by chemical and radioreceptor assays.

Kalso E(1), Vainio A, Mattila MJ, Rosenberg PH, Seppälä T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anaesthesia, Helsinki University, Central Hospital, Finland.

Morphine and oxycodone were administered to ten patients suffering from severe
cancer pain in a double-blind cross-over study. The patients titrated themselves 
pain-free, first intravenously, using a patient-controlled analgesia device, and 
then orally. Each titration phase lasted for 48 hours. Blood samples were drawn
after 36 hr of each administration phase. The plasma levels of morphine,
morphine-6- and morphine-3 glucoronides were determined with high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC), whereas the oxycodone samples were assayed with gas
chromatography (GC). Twin samples were analyzed for plasma opioid activity with a
radioreceptor assay (RRA) using 3H-dihydromorphine and 3H-naloxone as
radioligands. Adequate analgesia was achieved with both morphine and oxycodone.
About 30% more oxycodone was needed intravenously, whereas 25% less oxycodone
than morphine was consumed orally. There was a good linear correlation between
the morphine concentrations measured with HPLC and RRA. The mean
morphine-6-glucuronide to morphine concentration ratio was 2.3 after intravenous 
and 4.6 after oral administration. Results from RRA indicate that oxycodone in
vivo is a potent mu-agonist and that at least part of its analgesic action is
mediated by active metabolites. In vitro morphine glucuronides enhanced morphine 
in displacing radioligands from the opioid receptors, thus suggesting their
complex interactions in vivo.

Morphine and oxycodone hydrochloride in the management of cancer pain.

Kalso E(1), Vainio A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anesthesia, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland.

In a double-blind crossover study, morphine and oxycodone hydrochloride were
administered to 20 patients who were experiencing severe cancer pain. The peroral
doses were determined on the basis of patient-controlled intravenous titration.
The assumed oral bioavailability ratios were 44% (group 1, first 10 patients) and
33% (group 2, last 10 patients) for morphine and 66% (group 1) and 50% (group 2) 
for oxycodone hydrochloride, respectively. However, the patients were able to
readjust their oral dosings. Equal analgesia was achieved with both drugs, but
the intravenous dose of oxycodone hydrochloride needed was 30% higher than that
of morphine. The median calculated oral/intravenous ratios giving comparable
analgesia were 0.31 for morphine and 0.70 for oxycodone hydrochloride. Morphine
caused more nausea than oxycodone hydrochloride and hallucinations occurred only 
during morphine treatment. Otherwise, there were no major differences in the side
effects between these two opioids.

A multiinstitutional evaluation of the analgesic efficacy and safety of ketorolac
tromethamine, acetaminophen plus codeine, and placebo in cancer pain.

Carlson RW(1), Borrison RA, Sher HB, Eisenberg PD, Mowry PA, Wolin EM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Stanford University, California.

Seventy-five patients with moderate to severe cancer pain were randomly assigned 
in a double-blind fashion to receive first-dose ketorolac tromethamine 10 mg
orally, acetaminophen 600 mg plus codeine 60 mg orally, or placebo, followed by
subsequent doses of ketorolac or acetaminophen plus codeine four times daily for 
7 days. Patient characteristics were similar among the treatment groups. The
first-dose observation documented that both ketorolac and acetaminophen plus
codeine produced an equivalent reduction in cancer pain and were superior to
placebo as measured by pain intensity differences and pain relief. Multidose
comparison documented a small but statistically significant advantage in mean
daily pain relief favoring acetaminophen plus codeine, although there were no
differences in mean daily ratings of overall effects for either study medication.
Adverse symptoms were acceptable with both ketorolac and acetaminophen plus
codeine. We conclude that ketorolac has significant analgesic activity in
patients with cancer pain, although its precise role in the treatment regimen of 
these patients remains undefined.

A double-blind study was performed comparing 5 mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) p.o., 50 mg codeine p.o., and placebo in a patient with spasticity and pain
due to spinal cord injury. The three conditions were applied 18 times each in a
randomized and balanced order. Delta-9-THC and codeine both had an analgesic
effect in comparison with placebo. Only delta-9-THC showed a significant
beneficial effect on spasticity. In the dosage of THC used no altered

The analgesic efficacy and toxicity of oral diclofenac sodium 50 mg (q.i.d.) vs. 
nefopam 60 mg (q.i.d.) and a combination of 640 mg ASA and 40 mg codeine (q.i.d.)
in cancer patients with moderate to severe chronic pain has been evaluated in a
randomized double-blind study. Planned duration of treatment was 10 days. Pain
intensity was evaluated by a visual analog scale. The length of patient
participation in the trial, the patient's final global evaluation and the
incidence of side effects were also evaluated. Ninety-nine patients were enrolled
in the study. All treatments produced a statistically significant pain relief (P 
less than 0.01) without differences among groups but only 26 of 99 patients
(26.3%) completed the planned treatment period. Mean time in the study was 4.65
days. Inefficacy and side effects were the main reasons for premature treatment
interruption. Patients treated with nefopam had a significantly shorter period in
the study than patients treated with the other 2 treatments. Adverse effects were
slightly more frequent with the nefopam and ASA + codeine regimens. The 3
therapeutic regimens appear to be similar as to analgesic efficacy, but
diclofenac presents the advantage of a slightly better safety profile than
nefopam and the ASA + codeine combination.

Analgesic efficacy of ketoprofen in postpartum, general surgery, and chronic
cancer pain.

Sunshine A, Olson NZ.

This article summarizes the results of five single-dose clinical studies of three
pain models: postpartum, postoperative, and chronic cancer pain. The efficacy of 
ketoprofen (in varying doses from 25 to 225 mg) was compared with one of the
following standards: aspirin (650 mg), codeine (90 mg), acetaminophen (650 mg)
plus codeine (60 mg), and parenteral morphine (5 mg and 10 mg). The results
indicate that ketoprofen in doses as low as 25 mg has analgesic properties
significantly superior to those of placebo. For the treatment of postpartum pain,
ketoprofen was significantly more effective than aspirin 650 mg but not
significantly different from codeine 90 mg. Ketoprofen doses of 50 mg and 150 mg 
also provided analgesia superior to that with acetaminophen 650 mg plus codeine
60 mg for the management of moderate to severe postoperative pain. Moreover, oral
doses of ketoprofen (75 and 225 mg) provided analgesia similar to that obtained
with 5 and 10 mg parenteral doses of morphine. Adverse effects related to
ketoprofen were relatively minor and infrequent. Ketoprofen was recently approved
for use as an analgesic for treatment of mild to moderate pain in total daily
doses up to 300 mg; the recommended initial dose is 25 to 50 mg every 6 to 8
hours as necessary.

A double-blind parallel evaluation of the efficacy and safety of a single dose of
ketoprofen in cancer pain.

Stambaugh J(1), Drew J.

(1)Cooper Hospital, Camden, NJ.

The analgesic effects of single oral doses of ketoprofen 100 and 300 mg, the
combination of aspirin 650 mg plus codeine 60 mg, and placebo were compared under
double-blind conditions in 160 hospitalized patients with cancer pain. At
baseline and at 30 minutes and hourly for 6 hours after treatment, patients
evaluated their pain intensity and pain relief. The 100 mg ketoprofen dose was
significantly (P less than 0.05) superior to placebo for all 14 derived efficacy 
parameters; the 300 mg dose was significantly superior to placebo in all
assessments except derived onset of relief. Aspirin plus codeine was
significantly (P less than 0.05) superior to placebo for nine of the 14
assessments. No statistically significant differences were observed among active 
treatments for any of the 14 derived parameters. The number of patients with a
"good" response was greatest in the ketoprofen 100 mg group (55%); the numbers of
good responders in the aspirin plus codeine (37.5%) and the ketoprofen 300 mg
(30%) groups were comparable. The three active treatment groups were not
significantly different from each other for patient response. The numbers of
patients requiring rescue analgesic were significantly (P less than 0.05) lower
for both ketoprofen groups, but not for the aspirin plus codeine group, as
compared with the placebo group. Twenty-three percent of the 160 patients
reported adverse experiences, but there were no significant differences between
the treatment groups in the number or type of experience. These results show that
ketoprofen is as effective and well tolerated as aspirin plus codeine in
relieving cancer pain.

The combination of ibuprofen and oxycodone/acetaminophen in the management of
chronic cancer pain.

Stambaugh JE Jr(1), Drew J.

Hospital/University Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pa.

Thirty subjects with chronic moderate to severe pain who were receiving
oxycodone/acetaminophen (oxy/APAP) for analgesia were initially evaluated for at 
least 7 days for oxy/APAP requirements for pain control. Each subject then
received, in a randomized double-blind fashion, either 600 mg ibuprofen or
placebo for an additional 7 days while hospitalized. Oxy/APAP usage was recorded 
daily along with efficacy and toxicity parameters. Overall global evaluations
were also recorded on completion of the study. Comparison of mean differences
before and after treatment with ibuprofen or placebo indicated a marked decrease 
in oxy/APAP use with ibuprofen (p less than 0.01) and a slight increase in use in
the placebo group. Reduction in oxy/APAP usage occurred within 24 hours and
maximized at 5 days. Overall global scores showed a marked preference for the
ibuprofen combination over placebo (p less than 0.01). Daily pain intensity (p
less than 0.05) and pain relief scores (p less than 0.05) also improved with the 
addition of ibuprofen. This study indicates that ibuprofen is efficacious in the 
management of chronic cancer pain, resulting in both enhanced analgesia and a
reduction in concomitant narcotic use.

Comparison of the analgesic efficacy and safety oral ciramadol, codeine, and
placebo in patients with chronic cancer pain.

Stambaugh JE Jr(1), McAdams J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia.

Ciramadol is a new opioid agonist-antagonist analgesic with low potential for
dependency. Forty-three patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from
primary or metastatic malignancy of the bone or major organs were enrolled in a
randomized double-blind study that compared orally administered ciramadol (30 mg 
or 90 mg) to codeine (60 mg) and placebo. A single-dose, four-way crossover
design, with a randomized Latin-square treatment sequence, was used. Data for 40 
patients who received the above four study medications were included in the final
statistical analysis of efficacy. Analgesic efficacy was measured at 0, 0.5, 1.0,
2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 hours, using standard visual and verbal pain relief
and pain intensity scales. All active therapies provided greater pain relief than
placebo (P less than .05). Ciramadol 30 mg and codeine 60 mg demonstrated equal
analgesic activity, whereas ciramadol 90 mg was superior to both therapies. The
predominant adverse experiences associated with ciramadol were nausea and
drowsiness, which were apparently not dose related. Ciramadol appears to be an
effective analgesic at the doses tested, with tolerable gastrointestinal central 
nervous system side effects at both the 30-and 90-mg dose levels.

[Premedication in fiber optic bronchoscopy from the patient's and the physician's
viewpoint--a randomized study for the comparison of midazolam and hydrocodone].

[Article in German]

Mendes de Leon C, Bezel R, Karrer W, Brändli O.

To evaluate side effects and patients' assessment of fiberoptic bronchoscopy
under local anesthesia, 122 consecutive patients answered questions from an
outside interviewer (an experienced psychiatrist) and not from the endoscopists
themselves. The effect of premedication with midazolam (5 mg i.m.) and
hydrocodonum (15 mg i.m.) was compared in a randomized study. In a multiple
choice questionnaire 68% of all patients indicated considerable fear in the days 
before bronchoscopy. They were more afraid of the possible diagnosis of cancer
(23%) than of dyspnea or asphyxiation (14%). Coughing is considered the worst
side effect of bronchoscopy by 25% of patients (36% of the endoscopists) followed
by dyspnea during insertion of the scope (21%) and discomfort during local
anesthesia. Although the patients premedicated with midazolam are more sedated (p
= 0.025 by physicians' assessment vs. p = 0.11 in patients' view), they cough
more (p = 0.001 vs. p = 0.22) and usually tolerate the examination less well (p =
0.009 vs. p = 0.08) than patients premedicated with hydrocodonum. 42% of patients
premedicated with midazolam had anterograde amnesia. Although they did not
remember all the unpleasant side effects, only 77% said they would repeat the
procedure with the same premedication, compared with 90% of patients premedicated
with hydrocodonum (p = 0.08). Before and two hours after premedication the
reaction times had not changed (optical sign, Wiener reaction device) and were
identical in the two patient groups. At that time 37% of the patients
premedicated with midazolam and 27% of those premedicated with hydrocodonum were 
still sleepy and could not be regarded as fit for any form of travel.

Flurbiprofen for the treatment of bone pain in patients with metastatic breast
cancer.

Lomen PL, Samal BA, Lamborn KR, Sattler LP, Crampton SL.

Two investigators enrolled 26 women with metastatic breast carcinoma in a
six-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of flurbiprofen
(Ansaid, Upjohn) and placebo. The study was designed to determine the efficacy of
flurbiprofen in reducing bone pain due to metastatic breast cancer. Pain score,
overall performance, and concomitant use of narcotics were evaluated. The overall
mean differences in pain scores between flurbiprofen and placebo showed better
control of pain during treatment with flurbiprofen. None of these differences
approached statistical significance. Evaluation of overall performance status
reached statistical significance in one investigator's group. Three out of four
patients reported decreased consumption of acetaminophen/aspirin plus codeine
combinations while receiving flurbiprofen.

[Objectivation of the effect of antitussive agents using tussometry in patients
with chronic cough].

[Article in German]

Matthys H, Erhardt J, Rühle KH.

The antitussive effect of several antitussive agents has been objectively
evaluated in patients with chronic stable cough due to bronchial carcinoma,
pulmonary tuberculosis or chronic obstructive lung disease. The patients received
the active antitussive drugs or placebo in a double-blind, randomized crossover
design. The preparations were administered at 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. on 7 consecutive
nights and no antitussive was given for the following 20 hours. Cough frequency
and intensity were recorded from 10 p.m. until 6 a.m. The active medications were
noscapine (30 mg), dextromethorphan (20 mg), dihydrocodeine (30 mg) and codeine
(20, 30 and 60 mg) at 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Cough frequency and intensity were
objectively assessed with a pressure transducer placed over the trachea and
recorded on a chartrecorder. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of 
variance and multiple range testing. Noscapine, dextromethorphan, dihydrocodeine 
and codeine (60 mg) significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced the cough frequency
compared to placebo. They also produced a greater reduction of cough intensity
than placebo, codeine (20 mg) and codeine (30 mg) (p less than 0.001). The
duration of action of low-dose codeine (6 hours) was unsatisfactory. Subjective
preference for dextromethorphan indicates a psychotropic central nervous action
of this drug not assessed by the measuring device. Noscapine was equally well
tolerated but more neutral psychologically.

Analgesic efficacy of zomepirac sodium in patients with pain due to cancer.

Stambaugh JE Jr, Sarajian C.

In a single-dose, a double-blind crossover study in 40 patients with chronic pain
due to advanced cancer, zomepirac sodium (Zomax), a new, single-entity,
non-narcotic analgesic, was compared to oxycodone with APC (Percodan) and
placebo. Both a verbal and a curvilinear visual analog scale were used in the
study, and the results obtained were comparable. Zomepirac sodium, 100 mg,
provided analgesia equal to oxycodone with APC in all assessments of pain
intensity and pain relief. The analgesic activity of zomepirac sodium was
apparent by 1 hour, reached a peak between 3 and 4 hours after administration,
and lasted at least 6 hours. Zomepirac sodium, 100 mg, appears to be an
acceptable alternative to narcotic combinations such as oxycodone with APC in the
management of moderate to severe cancer pain. The visual analog scale presented
appears to be useful in the evaluation of analgesic efficacy and appears to be
acceptable as an alternative to the more conventional verbal scale.

Appraisal of codeine as an analgesic in older patients.

Jochimsen PR, Noyes R Jr.

In an investigation of a new oral analgesic agent, codeine was chosen as the
reference drug because of its established reputation as an effective agent for
the relief of pain. Thirty-five patients with cancer pain were studied. Their
average age was 58 years, During a 5-day hospital stay they received, on each of 
three days, either codeine (120 mg or 60 mg) or placebo. At hourly intervals
after ingestion the nurse observer collected data on pain intensity and the
degree of pain relief, and the patients independently charted the hourly
intensity. Statistical analysis failed to show any significant superiority of
either dose of codeine over placebo. Moreover, codeine is known to have a
constipating effect. Re-appraisal of the value of codeine as an analgesic agent
in elderly patients seems justified.

Analgesic studies of codeine and oxycodone in patients with cancer. I.
Comparisons of oral with intramuscular codeine and of oral with intramuscular
oxycodone.

Beaver WT, Wallenstein SL, Rogers A, Houde RW.

The relative analgesic potency of oral and intramuscular codeine was evaluated in
a double-blind crossover comparison of graded single doses in patients with
chronic pain due to cancer. When both duration and intensity of analgesia are
considered (total effect), oral codeine was 6/10 as potent as the intramuscular
form. This is a high oral/parenteral analgesic relative potency ratio compared
with morphine, metopon and oxymorphone and correlates well with the results of
recent studies which have determined the oral vs. intramuscular bioavailability
of codeine in man. Oral and intramuscular oxycodone were also compared in a
similar patient group. Like codeine, oxycodone retained at least 1/2 of its
analgesic activity when administered orally. We hypothesize that the high
oral/parenteral relative potency ratios of codeine and oxycodone relative to
morphine and its congeners are not due to more efficient absorption after oral
administration, but rather that methylation at position 3 in codeine and
oxycodone protects these drugs from rapid first-pass metabolism.

Analgesic studies of codeine and oxycodone in patients with cancer. II.
Comparisons of intramuscular oxycodone with intramuscular morphine and codeine.

Beaver WT, Wallenstein SL, Rogers A, Houde RW.

The relative analgesic potency of single graded intramuscular doses of oxycodone 
and morphine was evaluated in a double-blind study in patients with chronic pain 
due to cancer. When both intensity and duration of analgesia are considered
(total analgesic effect), oxycodone was 2/3 to 3/4 as potent as morphine, while
in terms of peak analgesia, it was 8/10 to equipotent. In doses producing
equivalent peak effect, oxycodone had a shorter duration of action than morphine.
Intramuscular oxycodone was also compared to intramuscular codeine in a similar
patient group. In terms of total analgesic effect, oxycodone was 10 times as
potent as codeine, while in terms of peak analgesia it was 12 times as potent.
These relative potency relationships of oxycodone, taken in conjunction with the 
oral/parenteral potency ratios of codeine and oxycodone established in the
previous paper and several previous relative potency assays involving morphine,
oxymorphone and codeine, demonstrate a highly consistent pattern of analgesic
structure-activity relationships encompassing morphine, oxymorphone, codeine and 
oxycodone. The results of these studies do not appear to support the hypothesis
that, in man, the analgesic activity of codeine is due to its O-demethylation to 
morphine.

Effect of benzopyranoperidine, a delta-9-THC congener, on pain.

Jochimsen PR, Lawton RL, VerSteeg K, Noyes R Jr.

In a double-blind, 5-way crossover designed study, single doses of placebo, 2
doses of codeine sulfate (60 and 120 mg), and 2 doses of benzopyranoperidine (2
and 4 mg) were administered orally to 35 patients who required analgesics for
chronic pain due to malignancies. Benzopyranopyridine is an analogue of
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and was chosen on the basis of its sedative,
hypnotic, and analgesic properties in animals. Pain relief scores indicated a
degree of relief of clinical significance with 120 mg of codeine but no
consistent difference between placebo and any other active agent. On the basis of
the data, bezopyranoperidine (2 or 4 mg) is not as effective as codeine (120 mg
or 60 mg) and not more effective than placebo in relieving pain due to cancer;
indeed, pain perception appeared to be augmented by both doses.

Effect of a nitrogen analog of tetrahydrocannabinol on cancer pain.

Staquet M, Gantt C, Machin D.

Two consecutive, randomized, double-blind trials were performed to test the
analgesic properties of a synthetic nitrogen analog of tetrahydrocannabinol
(NIB). In the first trial, the test preparation was superior to placebo and
approximately equivalent to 50 mg of codeine phosphate. In the second study, the 
tetrahydrocannabinol analog was superior to placebo and to 50 mg secobarbital.
NIB is not useful clinically because of the frequency of side effects.

The analgesic properties of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and codeine.

Noyes R Jr, Brunk SF, Avery DA, Canter AC.

The administration of single oral doses of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to 
patients with cancer pain demonstrated a mild analgesic effect. At a dose of 20
mg, however, THC induced side effects that would prohibit its therapeutic use
including somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, and blurred vision. Alarming adverse
reactions were also observed at this dose. THC, 10 mg, was well tolerated and,
despite its sedative effect, may analgesic potential.

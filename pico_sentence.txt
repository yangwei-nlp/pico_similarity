Pain is very common in patients with cancer. Opioid analgesics, including codeine, play a significant role in major guidelines on the management of cancer pain, particularly for mild to moderate pain. Codeine is widely available and inexpensive, which may make it a good
choice, especially in low-resource settings. Its use is controversial, in part because codeine is not effective in a minority of patients who
cannot convert it to its active metabolite (morphine), and also because of concerns about potential abuse, and safety in children.

To determine the efficacy and safety of codeine used alone or in combination with paracetamol for relieving cancer pain.
